Database Testing is a type of software testing that checks the schema, tables, triggers, etc. of the Database under test. It also checks data integrity and consistency. It may involve creating complex queries to load/stress test the Database and check its responsiveness.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="250" height="200" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/database-testing.png" alt="Database Testing">
Database Testing is important in software testing because it ensures data values and information received and stored into database are valid or not. Database testing helps to save data loss, saves aborted transaction data and no unauthorized access to the information. Database is important for any software application hence testers must have good knowledge of SQL for database testing.
The GUI is usually given the most emphasis by the test and development team members since the Graphical User Interface happens to be the most visible part of the application. However, what is also important is to validate the information that is the heart of the application, aka DATABASE.
Let us consider a Banking application wherein a user makes transactions. Now from Database Testing or DB Testing viewpoint following, things are important:
To ensure all these above objectives, we need to use data validation or data testing.

<img decoding="async" width="933" height="371" title="Database(Data) Testing Tutorial with Sample TestCases" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/typeofdbtest.jpg" alt="Types of Database Testing">
The 3 types of Database Testing are
In this Database Testing tutorial, we will look into each type and its sub-types one by one.
Structural Database Testing is a database testing technique that validates all the elements inside data repository that are mainly used for data storage and which are not allowed to be directly manipulated by end-users. The validation of database servers is also an important consideration in structural database testing. A successful completion of this testing needs mastery in SQL queries.
Schema Testing in database testing validates various schema formats associated with the database and verifies whether the mapping formats of tables/views/columns are compatible with mapping formats of user interface. The main purpose of schema testing is to ensure the schema mapping between front-end and back-end are similar. Thus, it is also referred to as mapping testing.
Let us discuss the most important checkpoints for schema testing.
Let us also look at some of the interesting Database Testing tools for validating database schemas.
For example, if the developers want to change a table structure or delete it, the tester would want to ensure that all the Stored Procedures and Views that use that table are compatible with the particular change. Another example could be that if the testers want to check for schema changes between 2 databases, they can do that by using simple queries.
Let us look into various checks for database and column testing.
of the back-end database columns with that of those present at the front-end of the application.
Important checks for keys and indexes –
constraints have been created on the required tables.
have been created on the required tables as specified by the business requirements.
Important tests to check stored procedures are:
Some of the useful Database Testing tools for testing stored procedures are LINQ , SP Test tool etc.
<img decoding="async" width="198" height="254" title="Database(Data) Testing Tutorial with Sample TestCases" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/databaseserver.png" alt="Database Server Validations">
Functional Database Testing is a type of database testing that is used to validate the functional requirements of a database from the end-user’s perspective. The main goal of functional database testing is to test whether the transactions and operations performed by the end-users which are related to the database works as expected or not.
Following are the basic conditions that need to be observed for database validations.
This particular process is the validation of the field mappings from the end-user viewpoint. In this particular scenario, the tester would perform an operation at the database level and then would navigate to the relevant user interface item to observe and validate whether the proper field validations have been carried out or not.
The vice versa condition whereby, first operation is carried out by the tester at the user interface, and then the same is validated from the back end is should also be done.
Following checks are important
The validations of the login and user security credentials need to take into consideration the following things.
Non-functional testing in the context of database testing can be categorized into various categories as required by the business requirements. These can be load testing, Stress Testing, Security Testing, Usability Testing, and Compatibility Testing, and so on. The load testing, as well as stress testing, which can be grouped under the gamut of Performance Testing serves two specific purposes when it comes to the role of non-functional testing.
Risk quantification– Quantification of risk helps the stakeholders to ascertain the various system response time requirements under required levels of load. This is the original intent of any quality assurance task. We need to note that load testing does not mitigate risk directly, but through the processes of risk identification and risk quantification, presents corrective opportunities and an impetus for remediation that will mitigate risk.
Minimum system equipment requirement– The minimum system configuration that will allow the system to meet the formally stated performance expectations of stakeholders. So that extraneous hardware, software, and the associated cost of ownership can be minimized. This particular requirement can be categorized as the overall business optimization requirement.
The purpose of any load test should be clearly understood and documented. The following types of configurations are a must for load testing.
Important load testing tools are LoadRunner Professional, win runner and JMeter.

Database Stress Testing is a testing method used to stress test database system with heavy load such that it fails at some point. This helps in identifying the breakdown point of database system. It requires proper planning and efforts in order to avoid over usage of resources. Data stress testing is also known as torturous testing or fatigue testing.
Important stress testing tools are LoadRunner Professional and JMeter.
Solution: The overall process planning and timing should be organized so that no time and cost based issues appear.
Solution: A prior plan and methodology for test data generation should be at hand.
Solution: Maintenance of the SQL queries and their continuous updating is a significant part of the overall testing process which should be part of the overall test strategy.
Solution: There should be a fine balance between quality and overall project schedule duration.
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" title="Database(Data) Testing Tutorial with Sample TestCases" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/truth.png" alt="Myths">
Reality: Effective and efficient Database Testing in Software Testing provides long-term functional stability to the overall application thus it is necessary to put in hard work behind it.
Reality: On the contrary, database testing adds more value to the overall work by finding out hidden issues and thus pro-actively helping to improve the overall application.
Reality: Significant amount of database testing helps in the overall improvement of quality for the database application.
Reality: Any expenditure on database testing is a long-term investment which leads to long-term stability and robustness of the application. Thus expenditure on Database Testing or SQL Testing is necessary.

Postman is a scalable API testing tool that quickly integrates into CI/CD pipeline. It started in 2012 as a side project by Abhinav Asthana to simplify API workflow in testing and development. API stands for Application Programming Interface which allows software applications to communicate with each other via API calls.
With over 4 million users nowadays, Postman Software has become a tool of choice for the following reasons:
Below is the Postman Workspace. Let’s explore the step by step process on How to use Postman and different features of the Postman tool!
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1899" height="663" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto7.png" alt="How To Use Postman To Execute APIs">
Get requests are used to retrieve information from the given URL. There will be no changes done to the endpoint.
We will use the following URL for all examples in this Postman tutorial https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users	
In the workspace
<img decoding="async" width="989" height="740" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto8.png" alt="Working with Get Requests">
*Note: There may be cases that Get Postman request may be unsuccessful. It can be due to an invalid request URL or authentication is needed.
Post requests are different from  Get request as there is data manipulation with the user adding data to the endpoint. Using the same data from the previous tutorial in Get request, let’s now add our own user.
Step 1) Click a new tab to create a new request.
<img decoding="async" width="398" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto9.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 2) In the new tab
<img decoding="async" width="632" height="259" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto10.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 3) In Body,
<img decoding="async" width="554" height="301" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto11.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 4) Copy and paste just one user result from the previous get request like below. Ensure that the code has been copied correctly with paired curly braces and brackets. Change id to 11 and name to any desired name. You can also change other details like the address.
<img decoding="async" width="603" height="518" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto12.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
*Note: Online Post request should have the correct format to ensure that requested data will be created. It is a good practice to use Get first to check the JSON format of the request. You can use tools like https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
<img decoding="async" width="1393" height="564" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto13.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
				Step 5)  Next,
<img decoding="async" width="864" height="536" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto14.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Data Parameterization is one of the most useful features of Postman. Instead of creating the same requests with different data, you can use variables with parameters. These data can be from a data file or an environment variable. Parameterization helps to avoid repetition of the same tests and iterations can be used for automation testing.
Parameters are created through the use of double curly brackets: {{sample}}. Let’s take a look at an example of using parameters in our previous request:
<img decoding="async" width="783" height="610" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto15.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
			Now let’s create a parameterize get request.
Step 1) 
There should be no response since we have not set the source of our parameter.
<img decoding="async" width="991" height="446" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto16.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
			Step 2) To use the parameter you need to set the environment
<img decoding="async" width="952" height="437" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto17.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
Step 3)  In variable,
<img decoding="async" width="716" height="554" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto18.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
Step 4) Click close if you see the next screen
<img decoding="async" width="720" height="575" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto19.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
Step 5) Go back to your Get request then click send. There should now be results for your request.
<img decoding="async" width="1197" height="816" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto20.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
*Note: Always ensure that your parameters have a source such as an environment variable or data file to avoid errors.
Postman Tests are JavaScript codes added to requests that help you verify results such as successful or failed status, comparison of expected results, etc. It usually starts with pm.test. It can be compared to asserts, verify commands available in other tools.
Let’s do some basic API testing using Postman for our parameterize requests from the previous lesson.
Step 1) Go to your GET user request from the previous tutorial.
The pane is auto-populated
<img decoding="async" width="1190" height="605" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto21.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 2) Now click Send. The test result should now be displayed.
<img decoding="async" width="1195" height="620" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto22.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 3) Go back to the test tab and let’s add another test. This time we will compare the expected result to the actual result.
From the snippets section, click on “Response body:JSON value check”. We will be checking if Leanne Graham has the userid 1.
<img decoding="async" width="853" height="349" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto23.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 4)
<img decoding="async" width="525" height="163" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto24.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 5) Click send. There should now be two passed test results for your request.
<img decoding="async" width="1537" height="680" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto25.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
*Note: There are different kind of tests that can be created in Postman. Try to explore the tool and see what tests will fit your needs.
Collections play an important role in organizing test suites. It can be imported and exported making it easy to share collections amongst the team. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create and execute a collection.
Let’s start in creating a collection:
Step 1) Click on the New button at the top left corner of the page.
<img decoding="async" width="227" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto26.png" alt="Create Collections">

Step 4)  Run Results page should be displayed after clicking the Run button. Depending on the delay, you should see the tests as they execute.
<img decoding="async" width="1244" height="762" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto36.png" alt="Run Collections Using Collection Runner">
You can see how important it is that there are tests in your requests so that you can verify HTTP request status if successful and the data is created or retrieved.
Another way to run a collection is via Newman. The main differences between Newman and Collection Runner are the following:
To install Newman and run our collection from it, do the following:
Step 1) Install nodejs using this link: http://nodejs.org/download/
Step 2) Open the command line and enter
Newman should now be installed on your computer.
<img decoding="async" width="950" height="181" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto37.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 3) Once Newman has been installed, let’s go back to our Postman workspace.In the Collections box, click on the three dots. Options should now appear. Select Export.
<img decoding="async" width="377" height="752" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto38.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 4) Choose Export Collection as Collection v2.1 (Recommended) then click Export.
<img decoding="async" width="583" height="370" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto39.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 5) Select your desired location then click Save. It is advisable to create a specific folder for your Postman tests. A collection should now be exported to your chosen local directory.
Step 6) We will also need to export our environment. Click on the eye icon beside the environment dropdown in Global, select Download as JSON. Select your desired location then click Save. It is advisable that the environment should be in the same folder as your collection.
<img decoding="async" width="889" height="654" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto40.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 7) Environment should now be exported to the same local directory as Collection.
Step 8) Now go back to command line and change the directory to where you have saved the collection and environment.
Step 9) Run your collection using this command:
Run results should now appear such as below.

<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira-testing-tool.png" alt="JIRA Testing Tool" width="750" height="250" />
JIRA is a tool developed by the Australian Company Atlassian. This software is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The JIRA full form is actually inherited from the Japanese word “Gojira” which means “Godzilla”. The basic use of this tool is to track issues and bugs related to your software and Mobile apps.
It is also used for project management. The JIRA dashboard consists of many useful functions and features that make handling of issues easy. Some of the key features are listed below. Now in these Jira tutorials, let’s learn JIRA Defect and Project tracking software with this Training Course.
Jira software can be used for the following purposes:
Here is a step by step process on how to use Jira software:
Below are 7 different teams that leverage JIRA to achieve their goals.
I use Tricentis Test Management for Jira as my test management solution. It allows me to handle all planning, tracking, and reporting directly within Jira.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/test-management-jira-logo.png" alt="Tricentis Test Management for Jira" width="330" height="62" />
It has an intuitive UI and uses Jira issues to define requirements and test cases, ensuring that QA and development share visibility into a single testing record. Unlike many of today’s Jira extensions, Test Management for Jira is low-cost and stays fast and performant as your team and projects grow, so you can scale without worry. Available for Jira Cloud.

Inside JIRA scheme, everything can be configured, and it consists of
This section in this Jira tutorial for beginners will guide you through JIRA Software Issues and their types.
JIRA issue would track bug or issues that underlies the project. Once you have imported the project then, you can create issues.
Under Issues, you will find other useful features like
Now, in this Jira Agile tutorial, let us see JIRA Issue in detail:
Issue Type displays all types of items that can be created and tracked via the Jira testing tool. JIRA Issues are classified under various forms, such as new feature, sub-task, bug, etc., as shown in the screenshot.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA1.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="752" height="441" />
There are two types of Issue types schemes in Jira project management tool:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA2.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="611" height="392" />
Apart from these two issue type schemes, you can also add schemes manually as per requirement, for example, we have created an IT & Support scheme, and for these, we will drag and drop the issue types from the Available Issue type to the Issue type for the current scheme as shown in the screen shot below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA3.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="752" height="368" />
Jira Components are sub-sections of a project; they are used to group issues within a project into smaller parts. Components add some structures to the projects, breaking it up into features, teams, modules, subprojects and more. Using components you can generate reports, collect statistics, and display it on dashboards and so on.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA4.jpg" alt="JIRA Components" width="752" height="210" />
To add new components, as shown in the above screen, you can add a name, description, component lead, and default assignee. 
When the issue is created in JIRA, it will be arranged and represented into different fields; this display of the fields in JIRA is known as a screen. This field can be transitioned and edited through workflow. For each issue, you can assign the screen type as shown in the screenshot. To add or associate an issue operation with a screen, you have to go to the main menu click on Issues click on Screen Schemes, and then click on “Associate an issue operation with a screen,” and add the screen according to the requirement. In this Jira tutorials for testers, we will learn about Jira Issue Attributes.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA5.jpg" alt="JIRA Screen" width="544" height="235" />
Issue Attributes encompasses:
Statuses: Different statuses are used to indicate the progress of a project like To do, InProgress, Open, Closed, ReOpened, and Resolved. Likewise, you have resolutions and priorities, in resolution it again tells about the progress of issue like Fixed, Won’t fix, Duplicate, Incomplete, Cannot reproduce, Done also you can set the priorities of the issue whether an issue is critical, major, minor, blocker and Trivial.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA6.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Attributes" width="752" height="437" />
This function in JIRA allows you to control who can view the issues. It consists of a number of security levels which can have users or groups assigned to them. You can specify the level of security for the issues while creating or editing an issue.
Similarly, there is a Default Permission Scheme. Any new project that is created will be assigned to this scheme. Permission Schemes allow you to create a set of permissions and apply this set-of-permissions to any project.
Some of the useful features that JIRA admin provides to users are:
Under Audit Log, you can view all the details about the issue created and the changes made in the issues.
This will show whether your issues link with any other issue that is already present or created in the project also you can de-activate Issue linking from the panel itself.
Using the Mail system in admin, you can mail issues to an account on a POP or IMAP mail server or messages written to the file system generated by an external mail service.
An event describes the status, the default template, and the notification scheme and workflow transition post-function associations for the event. The events are classified in two a System event (JIRA defined events) and Custom event (User defined events).
JIRA allows you to watch a particular issue, which informs you about notifications of any updates relating to that issue. To watch an issue, click on the word “watch” in the issue window. To see who is watching your issues, click on the number in brackets.
In the form of JIRA issues, an issue collector allows you to gather feedback on any website. In administration, if you click on Issue Collectors, an option will open asking to Add an Issue Collector. Once you have configured the look and feel of an Issue Collector, embed the generated JavaScript in any website for feedback.
You can also connect your Software development tools, including the Jira testing tool, to JIRA using this admin function. You have to enter the URL of the application to connect with JIRA.
I will guide you through the step-by-step process I use to create, edit, and summarize an issue in JIRA, an effective tool for testing.
Step 1) Open Jira software and login with your ID and password.
JIRA Dashboard will open when you enter your user ID and password. Under the free JIRA dashboard, you will find the option Project; when you click on it, it will open a window that lists options like Simple Issue Tracking, Project Management, Agile Kanban, Jira Classic, and so on, as shown in the screenshot below.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA7.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="653" height="299" />
Step 2) Provide issue details.
When you click on the option Simple Issue Tracking, another window will open, where you can mention all the details about the issue and assign the issue to the responsible person.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA8.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="327" />
Step 3) Provide detailed information to create an issue.
When you click on the “Submit” button, a window will open where you can perform a list of work like creating issues, assigning issues, checking the status of issues like- resolved, In-Progress or closed, and so on.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA9.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="725" height="433" />
Once the issue is created, a pop-up will appear on your screen saying your issue has been created successfully, as shown in the screenshot below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA10.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="64" />
Step 4) Open the Issues menu to search and perform multiple functions on issues.
Now, if you want to edit an issue or you want to export the issue to an XML or Word document, then you can hover your mouse on the main panel and click on Issues. Under Issues options, click on Search for issues, which will open a window from where you can locate your issues and perform multiple functions.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA11.png" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="602" height="286" />
When you select the “search for Issues” under Issues, a window will appear as shown in the screen shot:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA12.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="418" />
In the same window, you can set a filter for the issue and save it under Favorite Filters, so when you want to search or view a particular issue, you can locate it using the filter.
Step 5) Click on the Summary option to view the details about issues
To view the summary of the issue, you can click on options summary; this will open a window that will show all the details of your project and progress on this chart. On the right-hand side of the summary window, there is an Activity Stream, which gives the details about the issues and comments made by the assignee on the issue.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA13.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="787" height="429" />
Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into several smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do.
Sub-Task can be created in two ways:
To create a subtask in JIRA, you have to select an issue to which you want to assign the subtask. Under the issue window, click on the Assign more option, and then click on create subtask, as shown in the screenshot below. You can also select convert to subtask under the same tab to convert the parent issue into a subtask.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA14.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="752" height="437" />
Once you click Create Sub-Task, a window will pop up to add a sub-task issue. Fill up the details about the sub-task and click on Create as shown in below screen-shot, and this will create sub-task for the parent issue.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA15.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="625" height="441" />
It will create a sub-task under parent issues, and details will appear about when to complete the task on the issue type page,, as shown in the screenshot below. If you want to add more sub-tasks, you can click on the plus (+) sign in the corner of the sub-task panel. Likewise, if you want to note the time spent on the present task, click on the (+) plus sign in the corner of the time tracking and put down the details in the log sheet.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA16.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="706" height="150" />
Some important points to remember while creating Sub-Task:
A JIRA workflow is a set of statuses and transitions an issue undergoes during its lifecycle. Once the issue is created, the workflow encompasses five main stages.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA21.png" alt="WorkFlows" width="534" height="315" />
Workflow in JIRA comprises statutes, assignees, resolutions, conditions, validators, post-functions, and properties.
You can assign the issue’s status from the window itself when you click on the check box for IN Progress status, as shown in the screenshot below. The status will be reflected in the issue panel highlighted in yellow.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA22.png" alt="WorkFlows" width="602" height="281" />
For the issue we have created, JIRA will present a workflow that maps the project’s progress. As shown in screenshot whatever status that we have set in the Issue panel it will be reflected in Workflow chart, here we have set the issue status in “In Progress” and same status is updated in the workflow, highlighted in yellow. Workflow can give a quick overview of the work under process.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA23.jpg" alt="WorkFlows" width="707" height="369" />
There are plug-ins available for JIRA to work more effectively, some of these plugins are Zendesk, Salesforce, GitHub, Gitbucket, etc. Some of them enable the support team to report issues directly to JIRA, create unlimited private repositories with the full-featured issue and test management support, etc.
The Agile or Scrum method is generally used by development teams who follow a roadmap of planned features for upcoming versions of their product. Agile follows the same roadmaps to track their issues as in other JIRA methods To do -> In Progress -> Done, as shown in the screen shot below, we have one issue in To do and the second in In Progress. Once the issue in In Progress is resolved, it will move to Done status, and in the same way, the issue in To Do will move to the next stage, In Progress.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA24.png" alt="JIRA Agile" width="602" height="196" />
To create an Agile issue, go to the main menu under the Agile tab and click on “Getting Started.” when you click on it, it will ask you to create a new board for the issues for Scrum or Kanban. You can choose your option as per your requirement, here we have selected Scrum method.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA25.jpg" alt="Creating Issue in Agile" width="752" height="282" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA26.jpg" alt="Create an Epic in Agile" width="752" height="297" />
In JIRA Agile, an epic is simply an issue type. The epic captures a large body of work. It is a large user story that can be broken down into several small stories. To complete Jira Epic, it may take several sprints. You can either create a new epic in Agile or use the issue you have created in a normal JIRA board. Likewise, you can also create a story for agile scrum.
Plan Mode in Agile:
Plan mode displays all the user stories created for the project. You can use the left-hand side menu to decide the basis on which the issues must be displayed. While on the right-hand side menu clicking on the issue, you can create subtasks, logwork, etc.
Work Mode in Agile
It will display the active sprint information. All the issues or user stories will be displayed in three categories, as shown in the screenshot below: To do, In Progress, and Done, to show the progress of the project or issues.
In JIRA, you can also clone the issue; one advantage of cloning an issue is that the different teams can work separately on the issue and resolve the issue quickly.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA27.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="752" height="508" />
There is another useful function is JIRA Link, Issue linking allows you to create an association between two existing issues on either the same or different JIRA servers. As shown in the screenshot, we have linked the current issue, “ST-6 Drop down menu is not working,” with another issue, ” ST-4 GUI is not responsive- retest GUI functions”.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA28.png" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="593" height="276" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA29.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="771" height="326" />
Like here, we have set sprint for 1 day, and it will run sprint for that specific time period as shown in the screenshot below. If you are working with Scrum and want to prioritize the issue or rank the issue, then you just have to drag and drop the issue into the backlog.
Apart from this, there are multiple tasks that you can do; for instance, if you click on the right side corner of the window, a list of functions will pop up, that you can use as per your need.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA30.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="774" height="403" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA31.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="752" height="219" />
To track the progress in Agile, a Burndown Chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be done in the sprint. A typical burndown chart will look somewhat like this, where the red line indicates the actual task remaining while the blue line indicates the ideal task remaining during the scrum cycle.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA32.png" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="602" height="246" />
Apart from the burn-down chart, there are other options available in JIRA automation like Sprint Report, Epic Report, Version Report, Velocity Chart, Control Chart, and Cumulative flow diagram. You can also use different chart options to represent the progress of your project.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA33.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="623" height="381" />
Like the screen shot above, we have selected a pie chart for issue priorities. It will generate a Pie Chart representing the priorities and severity of the issues in percentage for the whole project,, as shown below. You can view the pie chart from different perspectives like Assignee, Components, Issue Type, Priority, Resolution, Status, etc.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA34.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="572" height="389" />
You can also configure how you want to see the scrum board. Scrum board gives various options through which you can make changes into your board appearance. Various features you can configure using Scrum are Columns, Swimlanes, Quick Filters, Card colors, and so on. Here, we have selected column management and selected the option Issue count, and it will show the total number of issues in progress, to do, or done. In column management, we can add an additional column as per our requirement likewise there are different features you can configure on the board.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA35.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="752" height="389" />
Filters
You can also set filters other than default filters to filter the issues. The filters that you can use are date, component, priority, resolution, and so on.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA36.jpg" alt="Filters" width="713" height="312" />
Like Agile Scrum board, we can also create a Kanban Board, here we have created a project name Cloud Testing. Kanban board is useful for the team that manages and constrains their work in progress. Kanban boards are visible in Work mode but not in Plan mode.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA37.jpg" alt="Kanban Board and Managing Issues" width="752" height="298" />
Here we have created an issue ” Bug detected while load testing” and “Check issues related to cloud server” in Kanban Board as shown in the screenshot below, it also shows their status as highlighted in red.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA38.jpg" alt="Kanban Board and Managing Issues" width="765" height="255" />
Kanban is considered the best methodology for bug fixing and maintenance release, where incoming tasks are prioritized and then worked accordingly. There are a few measures that can make Kanban more efficient.
From my experience, I can highlight the significant contrasts between JIRA Scrum and JIRA Kanban.
Burndown Chart: The chart shows all the changes and scope changed while the sprint is still on, other charts include Sprint Report, Velocity Chart, Epic Report, etc.
Control Chart: It allows you to measure the cycle time for issues, showing the mean time and actual time taken to complete issues.
It allows the team to see the progress of sprints. This is the work mode, where you can see the board itself broken down into different statuses.
The team can decide whether to increase or decrease the number of issues that should be displayed in each status.
This is where the team will plan sprints and estimate stories going into each sprint.
You can map columns to the statuses of your workflow. Simply by adding or removing columns, the workflow can be changed when required.

SAP PI (Process Integration) is an enterprise integration platform that provides seamless integration between SAP and non-SAP applications within the organization A2A (Application to Application) or even outside the organization B2B (Business to Business). It allows organizations to exchange information between internal softwares within the company and external systems outside the company.
The SAP PI full form is Process Integration.
SAP PO (Process Orchestration) is a tool for automation and optimization of business processes. It combines features of SAP Business Process Management (BPM), SAP Process Integration (PI), and SAP Business Rules Management (BRM). In other words, SAP Process Orchestration is a more advanced version of SAP PI and has all the tools required to integrate applications.
The SAP PO full form is Process Orchestration.
But this was a technical aspect of SAP PI, but to understand this better we will see the example of implementation of SAP Process Integration.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="630" height="418" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/11-2014/112814_0608_SAPPIProces1.png" alt="Understanding SAP PI/PO with an Example">
To understand the concept of SAP PI more clearly, we take an example of a large-scale Dairy Industry, which is operating in a large portion of a state and dominating the region. But there is some small-scale dairy industries operating in the same region, parallel to the large-scale industry which is not making a profit due to their price variation compare to large-scale industry. So to avoid the pricing conflict and maintaining the same price all over the region, large scale and small scale industry decide to link together, with the help of SAP PI. They interconnect with each other with the help of SAP PI and started to work as a single unit. Now, through SAP PI they are able to exchange all the information pertaining to dairy industry, including pricing and share an equal amount of profit.
SAP PI connects different platforms like 
Prior to SAP PI, business would connect with each other through point-to-point communication. But this process is not used for multiple and complex processes. For smooth communication between multiple businesses, Mediated communication or Integration broker is used, and SAP PI adapts this system very well. It enables interconnection of a different process via a central location known as Integration Broker, unlike the point to point connection which is more like a spider web. The integration broker or server is an integral part of mediated communication consist of Java based Advanced Adapter Engine (AAE) and an integration engine for routing. Mediated communication is based on an integration broker which is executed by exchanging XML messages.
Let see how SAP PI handles the XML messages by the help of Integration Broker. The exchange of data or message in SAP PI occurs in this four phases.
Next in this SAP PI tutorial, we will learn How SAP PI/PO works.
SAP PI performs three basic functions
Next in this SAP PO tutorial, we will learn about SAP PI PO architecture.

SAP PI is not a single component responsible for the integration of SAP and Non- SAP application, but it is a cluster of components that together make SAP PI functional. This architecture of SAP PI or components is used during design time, configuration time and at run time. The various components of SAP PI include
It is a central information provider in a system landscape. SLD contains two types of information, “Component Information (Installable & Installed) and Landscape description.”
It is a tool-set which contains a set of tools for accessing and editing integration objects
To develop, design and maintain data types, message structures, mappings, interfaces, integration processes and integration scenarios independently of system landscape, integration repository is used.
It is a central processing engine of the PI. All messages are processed using this server.
With the help of this monitoring of PI domain is done, and “workbench” is the tool that is used for monitoring.
It acts as a connector to connect the integration engine to SAP systems and other systems.
To access data from SAP and Non-SAP application this technique is used. SAP PI uses an intermediate document like IDoc to Flat files to transfer their data.
Process Integration (PI) uses integration repository to design message structure
Integration Directory (ID) is used to configure technical parameters for objects created in IR ( Integration Repository)
Once the IDOC is activated in SAP system, PI takes in charge and convert messages into XML format for its internal processing
The messages can be monitored and traced using “Run Time Workbench”. This tool can be useful in monitoring sender and receiver adapters, Outgoing and Incoming messages, End to End monitoring of complete scenario and error traces.
SAP PI connects with any external systems (SAP or Non-SAP) using the Adapter Framework. The adapter framework is based on the AS Java runtime environment and the connector architecture (JCA) version. The adapter framework consists of two default module chains if message processing is to be executed entirely within the adapter, default module chain for the adapter can be used.
There are four types of Adapters used in SAP PI
Other interfaces supported by adapter framework are

For messages, SAP PI provides the message level security for XI message protocol, for the SOAP adapter, for the RosettaNet protocol, for mail adapter, for the CIDX protocol and for connectivity with WSRM (Web Service Reliable Messaging) enabled systems. In SAP PI message level security enabled through the use of encryption, digital signature, SAML Assertion, Username token, Certificate token, etc. Authentication methods supported by WS infrastructure for transport level includes basic authentication (Password and Username), SAP assertion ticket, and HTTP over SSL.
Connecting Integration Server with WSRM (Web Service Reliable Messaging) Enabled System
To connect with WSRM enabled system you use a communication channel of adapter type WS.
The new features in SAP PI include
When SAP PI/PO is not recommended in enterprise SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

Let’s start this SAP APO Tutorial with introduction of SAP APO:
SAP APO is a key component of SAP to form a technical foundation for SAP modules. It is designed for high consistency in business processes, from order generation to production planning, and improving customer service while reducing costs.  It is used for SCM (Supply Chain Management) to plan and execute supply chain processes. SAP APO stands for Advanced Planner Optimizer.
It is also known as APS (Advance Planning and Scheduling) tool.
Another important function of SAP APO Module is the SCC (Supply Chain Cockpit), it provides users with a graphical instrument panel for controlling and managing the supply chain. Various department of a company uses SCC like demand planners, strategic planners and production planners.
Following are components of SAP APO

Let’s look into them in detail!
To run a successful business, market forecasting and planning is an important factor. “Demand Planning” is the art of understanding customers future demand and execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management.  SAP Demand Planning provides advanced forecasting and demand planning tools that help companies to identify changes in demand as early as possible. Marketing and promotion are also done by the forecast of market demand using SAP APO Demand Planning.
SNP (Supply Network Planning) integrates information on purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and transportation so that tactical planning and decision can be made and implemented based on a single consistent model. Based on heuristic and mathematical optimization methods, SAP APO SNP ensures that organization or company meets the demand and performs activities like transportation, production, and warehousing resources.
For instance, the deployment function determines how and when the inventory should be deployed to distribution centers or warehouse.
It allows manufacturing units to plan material and critical resources in an optimal fashion.  A frequent demand for manufacturing units is to produce with limited resources.
PP/DS helps to analyze the lead time and resources required for production.  You can reduce the inventory cost, increase on-time delivery performance, and reduce lead time for the product using SAP PPDS.
The purpose of “Global available-to-promise” is to determine whether the requested product by the customer would be available on given or promised date.  The process deals with improving, on-time delivery performance, planning system integration and sufficiently increasing stock to buffer inventories.
By opting for best and short route of transportation, a company can save time, money and fuel spent on transporting and delivering goods. TP/VS provides transportation planner and schedules the routes at lower transportation cost. It offers functions like shipment consolidation, route determination, carrier selection, multi-pick, and multi-drop, etc.
On manifesting positive outcome of SAP APO System for business process, SAP APO is enhanced with extra features like
Although SAP APO is no longer marketed as a separate solution, its functionality underlies SAP CRM, SAP E-Procurement, and SAP Supply Chain Management.  Because of its open architecture, it is open to future enhancement like model functionality, higher degrees of parallelization and improved optimization algorithms.

SAP HANA is the latest, in-memory database, and platform which can be deployed on-premises or cloud. SAP HANA is a combination of hardware and software, which integrates different components like SAP HANA Database, SAP SLT (System Landscape Transformation) Replication server, SAP HANA Direct Extractor connection, and Sybase replication.
HANA has unprecedented adoption by the SAP customers. SAP HANA is capable of processing a large amount of real time data in a short time period.
There are different types of SAP HANA edition, some of them as below-
The following diagram shows difference between all editions –
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="294" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/sap-hana/030116_1025_WhatisSAPHA1.png" alt="SAP HANA Training Tutorials for Beginners">
SAP HANA is a next-generation in-memory business platform. It accelerates analytics and application on a single and in-memory platform.


SAP HANA has many processes running on the SUSE Linux Server. SUSE Linux server manages the reservation of memory to all process.
When SAP HANA starts up, Linux OS reserves memory for the program code, program stack, and static data. OS can dynamically reserve additional data memory upon request from the SAP HANA Server.
SAP HANA create a memory pool for managing and tracking the consumption of memory. The memory pool is used to store all the in-memory data and system tables, thread stack, temporary computations and all other data structure required for managing the database.
<img decoding="async" width="573" height="452" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/sap-hana/030116_1025_WhatisSAPHA2.png" alt="SAP HANA">
When more memory is required for table growth or temporary computations, the SAP HANA memorymanager obtains this from the pool.
For an overview, check out the Memory Overview feature of the SAP HANA studio. To access it, right-click on a System ->Configuration and Monitoring -> Open Memory Overview in the context menu, as follows:

Below are advantages of SAP HANA –
Currently, SAP HANA also work as in-Memory database for SAP BW, so in this way SAP HANA able to improve the overall performance of SAP Net weaver BW.
SAP HANA Information composer is a web application that allows us to do modelling and upload local data to SAP HANA database.
This is Modelling environment for non-technical people like an end user. Information Composer works same as SAP HANA Modeler and used by Business user with less technical knowledge.
A Large amount of data (up to 5 million of cell) can be uploaded using Information Composer.
Role required for work with SAP HANA Information Composer –
SQL Expressions is a clause that can be used for return values. There are 4 types of SQL Expressions-
A trigger is also a stored procedure that automatically executes when an event happens on a given table or view.
The database users only having the TRIGGER privilege for the given <subject_table_name>  are allowed to create a trigger for that table or view.
The CREATE TRIGGER command defines a set of statements that are executed when a given operation (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) takes place on a given subject table or subject view.

Data profiling is the process of analyzing the data available in an existing data source and collecting statistics and information about that data.  SQL  DATA profiling task is used to understand and analyze data from different data source. By Data profiling process user can remove incorrect and incomplete data before loading to the data warehouse.
Advantage of SAP HANA SQL DATA Profiling is as below –

SAPUI5 is a set of libraries to build responsive web applications that run on multiple devices like Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet. SAPUI5 works on MVC concept to accelerate the development cycle by creating data, business logic, and representation of data separately on the view. So the development of view and controller can take place independently to create models (data containers).
SAPUI5 is the latest in the series of SAP UI development technologies. In order to provide web integration for the underlying SAP ERP system, SAP came up with multiple UI development technologies like BSP (Business server pages), PDK (Portal development kit), Web Dynpro Java, Web Dynpro ABAP. And the successor of Web Dynpro ABAP is SAPUI5.
In the above Architecture, first box, i.e. ‘Devices’ indicate the devices on which UI5 applications run. UI5 applications can be accessed via a Mobile app or any browser on these devices. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Presentation Layer.’
SAPUI5 applications and oData services reside on SAP NetWeaver Gateway Server. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Application Layer.’
Actual business logic is implemented in SAP core systems like ECC, CRM, and BW, etc.… Business logic can be implemented using SAP programs and function modules. SAP transactional and Master Data reside on SAP systems. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Database Layer’ or ‘Persistence Layer.’
A Component is a piece of working code that is reused wherever required. There are 2 types of components provided by SAPUI5
Essentially, a Component is a folder. When you create a new SAPUI5 application, you will be able to see a folder structure created in your project explorer like below.
<img decoding="async" width="360" height="223" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor2.png" alt="SAPUI5 Component">
In this UI5 application, PassNum is a Component. Component.js file is mandatory for UI5 application to behave like a Component. Component.js file is the component controller.
Next in this SAPUI5 Eclipse tutorial, we will learn how to setup SAPUI5.
Before we start, you need to ensure that –
After the application is completely built, it should look like below:
<img decoding="async" width="950" height="531" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor3.png" alt="SAPUI5 Setup">
In this SAPUI5 tutorials guide, we will create 2 components namely Parent Component and Child Component. First, we will create Child Component and then consume it in Parent component.
Let’s start getting our hands dirty.
Our goal is to create a Child Component that will accept a number from 1 to 12 and display the name of the month. For example, it receives 3; it should display ‘March’.
Go to File->New->Other->SAPUI5 Application Development->Application project.
<img decoding="async" width="672" height="460" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor4.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Create an application project for SAPUI5 by following the wizard that opens up. See screenshot below.
<img decoding="async" width="526" height="507" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor5.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Enter Name of the project, let the other selections remain the same as suggested by the wizard.
<img decoding="async" width="525" height="497" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor6.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
In the above screenshot, there are 2 types of libraries displayed as radio buttons
When you select sap.m, you are telling the wizard to create a UI5 application project whose bootstrap section will automatically include sap.m library which is meant for creating a responsive web application.
Next in this SAP FIORI tutorial, you will see below section of the wizard where you need to create initial View. An Initial view is a view which will be rendered first when the application is accessed.
<img decoding="async" width="509" height="661" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor7.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Here you need to give the name of the view and select type of the view. SAPUI5 supports 4 types of view as evident on the above screen. So the UI of a SAPUI5 application can be built using Javascript or XML or JSON or HTML whichever language you are comfortable with.
At the end of the wizard, a new project will be created and displayed on Project Explorer window of Eclipse like below.
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="229" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor8.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Next, let us create a Component.js file and write below code in it.
Next, let us tell out the index.html file to load Component.js in SAPUI5 when the application is accessed from the browser. So write below code in the index.html file.
Next, let us write code in our displaymonth view which will display the Month whose month number is received from the parent Component.
After you’ve pasted above code, your view should look like below-
<img decoding="async" width="572" height="322" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor9.png" alt="DisplayMonthView.view.xml code">
And finally, let us write code of DisplayMonthView’s Controller file.
The code is written only in the onInit() hook method of this controller hence pasting here only the onInit() code. Rest of the file is as generated by the framework.
Deploy the project and give the technical name of the BSP application which will be generated on the ABAP frontend server. Let the name be zdisplaymonth. At this point, your application project should look like below.
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="251" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor10.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server">
Now it is the time to create a new Component (Parent Component) which will consume the Component we created so far in this tutorial.
Go to File->New->Other->SAPUI5 Application Development->Application project. Then follow wizard instructions to create new SAPUI5 application project. This has been described in detail in Step 1 of Part 1 in this tutorial above.
Name of the parent Component project is PassNum. And the technical name of the BSP application generated after deployment of SAPUI5 component to ABAP frontend server is zpassnum. The project structure will look like below
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="288" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor11.png" alt="Create a new SAPUI5 application">
Let us now write code in index.html, Component.js and PassNum.view.xml and PassNum.controller.js files
After you use above code in your view, your view should look like below
<img decoding="async" width="826" height="453" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor12.png" alt="Source code of PassNum.view.xml file">
Only the onInit() method has been changed. Everything else in this file remains the same
Deploy the application on ABAP frontend server and run it. You should be able to run it by right-clicking on the project and clicking ‘Run on ABAP server’ option.
<img decoding="async" width="635" height="597" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor13.png" alt="Deployment of Parent Component to SAP Netweaver Gateway Server">
Below URL will open up in eclipse browser.
http://hostname:8000/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zpassnum/index.html
Copy the URL and run it in the actual browser. In the above hostname marked in yellow is the hostname of your ABAP frontend server.
<img decoding="async" width="970" height="422" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor14.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server Output">
Click on ‘First’ button, January should display in the Child Component.
<img decoding="async" width="970" height="504" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor15.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server Output">
Enjoy creating beautiful, responsive web applications using SAPUI5.

Before we learn SAP BODS overview, let’s understand
ETL stands for Extract-Transform-Load, and it is a process of how data is loaded from the target system to the data warehouse. Data is extracted from a database and transformed to match according to the data warehouse schema. After that, it is loaded back to the data warehouse database in the form of dimension and fact tables.
SAP BODS is an ETL tool for extracting data from disparate systems, transform data into meaningful information, and load data in a data warehouse. It is designed to deliver enterprise-class solutions for data integration, data quality, data processing and data profiling. The full form of SAP BODS is Business Objects Data Services.
Here, are famous landmarks in the history of SAP BODS:
Here, are some basic components of SAP BODS architecture:
A repository is a set of a table which holds user-created and predefined system object, source, target metadata, and transformation rules. It allows you to set up repositories on an open client/server platform. This helps you for sharing metadata with other enterprise tools. Each local repository is connected with one or more job server which runs the job you have created.
SAP BOD Data Services Management Console is the web-based application with the following features.
The Job Server component helps you to starts the data movement engine. It allows you to integrate data from multiple sources. It helps you to perform complex data transformations and manages transactions and extractions from ERP systems and other sources.
The Data integration Job server tool allows you to move in data in either batch or real-time mode. It delivers high data throughput and scalability. Moreover, while designing a job, you can also run it from the Designer which tells the Job Server to run the job. The Job Server also allows you to get the job from its associated BODS SAP repository.
The Data services Designer tool offers an easy-to-use graphical user interface that helps you define transformations, data mappings, and control logic.
This component helps you to build applications containing data and workflows. This component also allows you to manage metadata stored in a repository.
After SAP BusinessObjects Data Services job are executed, the Job Server starts the engine to perform data extraction, transformation, and movement. The engine uses parallel processing and in-memory data transformation to offer high data connectivity, quality, and scalability.
Access server offers real time request-reply message that collects message request routes them to a real-time service and delivers a message reply in a specific duration. The Acess Server queries message and sends them to the next available real-time service across numerous computing resources.
The next component is the Address Server. It offers address validation and corrections. The Address Server must be started before processing data flows which contain the Global address Cleanse or Global Suggestion list transform with the EMEA engine enabled.
A Datastore offers a connection to a data source like a database. It is a linking interface between the actual backend database and Data services. Data store also allows data services to import the description of the data source such as metadata.
CMC is a web-based administration tool for BOD. It is a helpful tool to perform some essential functions like repository registration, user management, etc.
Data Integrator web administrator is also known as DI web admin. It helps you to maintain repositories in Data services. This SAP BOD services included in DI web admin are Meta Repository, Central Repository, job services, and web services.
Here are a few pros of BODS in SAP
Here, are few draws backs of using SAP BODS.

In this SAP Security tutorial for beginners, we will learn about SAP Security basic concepts.
SAP Security is a balancing act for protecting the SAP data and applications from unauthorized use and access. SAP offers different tools, processes and measures for security check to protect these data. SAP security helps to ensure that users can only use the functionality of SAP which is a part of their job.
SAP Systems contain very sensitive and confidential data of their clientele and businesses. Hence, there is a need for a regular audit of an SAP computer system to check its security and data integrity.
For instance, an employee in a warehouse who is responsible for creating a purchase order shall not approve a rightful purchase order or otherwise he may create and approve as many purchase order without any use.
In such scenario, the purchase order approval should be controlled by a higher authority which is a standard security feature.
Next in this SAP Security for beginners tutorial, we will learn about various Security concepts in SAP.
Below are the main Security Concepts in SAP:
Transaction codes are the front door to get the access to SAP’s functionality. STAD data provide security against unauthorized transaction access. Does it keep a record of information like who accessed certain critical functionality? And when? STAD data can be used to monitor, analyze, audit and maintain the security concept.
SAP Cryptographic Library is the default encryption product delivery by SAP. It is used for providing Secure Network Communication (SNC) between various SAP server components. For front-end components, you need to buy an SNC certified partner product.
To make SAP system application available for access from a web browser, a middleware component called Internet Transaction Server (ITS) is used. The ITS architecture has many built-in security features, such as to run the Wgate and Agate on separate hosts.
The basic security tools that SAP uses are Firewalls & DMZ, Network Ports, SAPRouter, etc. A firewall is a system of software and hardware components which define the connections that should pass back and forth between communication partners. SAP Web dispatcher and SAPRouter are examples of application level gateways that you can use for filtering SAP network traffic.
SSL (Secure Socket Layer), is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and client.  With SSL you can authenticate the communication partners(server & client), by determining the variables of the encryption.
With sap cyber security, both partners are authenticated. The data transferred between the server and client will be protected so any manipulation in the data will be detected. In addition to that data transferred between the client and server is also encrypted. Enterprise portal security guide can be helpful to secure the system by following their guidelines.
The SAP single sign-on function enables you to configure same user credentials to access multiple SAP systems.  It helps to reduce administrative costs and security risk associated with maintaining multiple user credentials.  It ensures confidentiality through encryption during data transmission.
AIS or Audit Information System is an auditing tool that you can use to analyze security aspects of your SAP system in detail. AIS is designed for business audits and systems audits. AI presents its information in the Audit InfoStructure.
Next in this SAP Security tutorial, we will learn about SAP security for mobile apps.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="268" height="387" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/blog/sap_security_2.jpg" alt="SAP Security for Mobile SAP Apps">
SAP applications are now available on mobile with an increase in the mobile users. But this exposure is a potential threat. The biggest threat for an SAP app is the risk of an employee losing important data of customers.
The good thing about mobile SAP is that most mobile devices are enabled with remote wipe capabilities.  And many of the CRM- related functions that organizations are looking to mobilize are cloud-based, which means the confidential data does not reside on the device itself.
Some of the popular mobile SAP security providers are SAP Afaria, SAP Netweaver Gateway, SAP Mobile Academy and SAP Hana cloud.
Next in this SAP Security for beginners tutorial, we will learn about best practices for SAP security.

For any organization to run a business successfully financial planning, budgeting, and forecasting are important attributes. SAP BPC software provide everything in one package.
Let’s see each attribute of SAP BPC in detail,
It helps management team to formulate its vision, mission, core values, and objectives. The team develops strategic plans to uphold its competitive advantage in the marketplace. It helps them to answer the following questions.
It is not just a prediction of future results. It is also a plan of actions and expected operations of the organization over the next year. Budgeting is done for proactive management and measurement of corporate performance.
It ensures performance progress is monitored, problems are anticipated, and continuous improvement efforts are promoted.
It is the act of predicting outcomes. It is done throughout the year to reflect changes that have occurred both in the internal and external environment. It determines how the internal or external environment impact on the original plans and budgets? The main objective is to provide more accurate information for less risk management planning and decision making.
The EPM solution use is widening over the financial divisions. It is similar to CPM (Corporate Performance Management), BPM( Business Performance Management) and FPM (Finance Performance Management). EPM is being used as a unique repository to manage relevant information.
SAP BPC Architecture. It uses various business rules and script logics for doing the planning. The key components in BPC architecture are shown in the image below.
BPC Administration allows administrators to perform maintenance and setup tasks for BPC client applications.
BPC financial administration has two interfaces; a client application and a web interface. The administration action pane lists the available tasks for both interfaces

The console client is a Microsoft explorer-like window. Where we manage items such as application sets, applications, business rules, dimensions and business process flows. The browser client allows to control application set and application properties, as well as maintain BPC web parameters.
Dimensions represent the entities of a business (e.g., accounts, company codes, and categories). They represent the master, text, and hierarchy data for each of the business entities.
It is possible to create new dimensions in a BPC application set. There is no restriction to create a number of dimensions in SAP BPC. These dimensions then become shared dimensions that are available for use in any application within the appset.
Some dimensions are required dimensions. It must exist in all the applications within an application set. While the dimension type determines the default properties to be included in the dimension. It is possible to add additional properties as needed.
Required in each application
Required in each application set
Needed to validate currencies that are input in Entity type dimension. This may not be part of any applications within the application set
It is also possible to create additional dimensions as a requirement
Un = User defined dimension type. For each user-defined dimension, the number ‘n’ will be incremented. For e.g; U1, U2, U3 and so on
Select Dimension Library on the left side. The action pane will display the related dimension tasks.
<img decoding="async" width="591" height="355" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/7-2016/072216_1113_SAPBPC3.png" alt="Creating Dimensions">
To create a new dimension, click on “Add a new dimension”.
<img decoding="async" width="916" height="473" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/7-2016/072216_1113_SAPBPC4.png" alt="Creating Dimensions">
Similarly, it is possible to copy, modify, process and delete dimensions. While adding dimensions, you need to enter reference type.
Next in this SAP BPC training, we will learn about BPC reporting.
BPC for Office combines the power of BPC with the rich functionality of Microsoft Excel, Word, and Powerpoint. With BPC for Office, we have all of the Microsoft functionality we are used to. On top of it documents, worksheets, and slideshows can be linked directly to the BPC database that has Company’s reporting data.
BPC for Office allows to collect data, build reports, perform real-time analysis and publish reports in a variety of formats. You can save your reports so that you can use them disconnected from the database. You can take reports completely offline and distribute them based on user access rights
A sample layout looks as follows

Apache is a remarkable piece of application software.  It is the most widely used Web Server application in the world with more than 50% share in the commercial web server market. Apache is the most widely used Web Server application in Unix-like operating systems but can be used on almost all platforms such as Windows, OS X, OS/2, etc. The word, Apache, has been taken from the name of the Native American tribe ‘Apache’, famous for its skills in warfare and strategy making.
It is a modular, process-based web server application that creates a new thread with each simultaneous connection. It supports a number of features; many of them are compiled as separate modules and extend its core functionality, and can provide everything from server side programming language support to authentication mechanism. Virtual hosting is one such feature that allows a single Apache Web Server to serve a number of different websites.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="564" height="385" alt="Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache1_1.jpg">
There are numerous ways of installing the package or application.  There are enlisted below –
The apache web server is a modular application where the administrator can choose the required functionality and install different modules as per his/her requirement.
All modules can be compiled as a Dynamic Shared Objects (DSO is an object file that could be shared by multiple apps while they are executing) that exists separately from the main apache file.  The DSO approach is highly recommended, it makes the task of adding/removing/updating modules from the servers configuration very simple.
On Red Hat or rpm based systems
If you are using an rpm (RedHat Package Manager is a utility for installing application on Linux systems) based Linux distribution i.e. Red Hat, Fedora, CentOs, Suse, you can install this application by either vendor specific Package Manager or directly building the rpm file from the available source tarball.
You can install Apache via the default Package Manager available on all Red Hat based distributions like CentOs, Red Hat and Fedora.
The apache source tarball could be converted into an rpm file using the following command.
It is mandatory to have -devel package installed on your server for creating .rpm file from source.
Once you convert the source file into an rpm installer, you could use the following command to install Apache.
After the installation the server does not start automatically, in order to start the service, you have to use any of the following command on Fedora, CentOs or Red Hat.
Installing apache from the source require the –devel package to be installed on your server. .You can find the latest available version of Apache, you can download it here .  Once you download the source file move it to the /usr/local/src folder.
In order to see all configuration option available for Apache, you can use ./configure –help option.  The most common configuration option is –prefix={install directory name}.
The above example shows the compilation of Apache within the /usr/local/apache directory with the DSO capability. The –enable-so option, can load required modules to apache at run time via the DSO mechanism rather than requiring a recompilation.
Once the installation completes, you can browse the web servers default page with your favorite browser.  If firewall is enabled on your server, you must have to make exception for port 80 on your OS firewall.  You can use the following command to open port 80.
service iptables save
You can see the default Apache2 Welcome screen by browsing your server IP address.
<img decoding="async" width="1016" height="708" alt="Install Apache from Source" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache1_2.jpg">
An Apache web server can host multiple websites on the SAME server. You do not need separate server machine and apache software for each website. This can achieved using the concept of Virtual Host or VHost.
Any domain that you want to host on your web server will have a separate entry in apache configuration file.
<img decoding="async" width="518" height="397" alt="Virtual Host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_1.jpg">

Name based virtual hosting is used to host multiple virtual sites on a single IP address. 
<img decoding="async" width="550" height="283" alt="Name-based Virtual Host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_2.jpg">
In order to configure name based virtual hosting, you have to set the IP address on which you are going to receive the Apache requests for all the desired websites.  You can do this by NameVirutalHost directive within the apache configuration i.e. httpd.conf/apache2.conf file.

You can add as many virtual hosts, as per your requirement. You can check your web configuration files with:
If the configuration file has some wrong syntax, it will throw an error
In order to setup IP based virtual hosting, you need more than one IP address configured on your server.  So, the number of vhost apache will depend onnumber of IP address configured on your server.  If your server has 10 IP addresses, you can create 10 IP based virtual hosts.
<img decoding="async" width="545" height="275" alt="IP-based Virtual host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_3.jpg">

In the above diagram two websites example1.com and example2.com were assigned different IPs and are using IP-based virtual hosting.

Running Php files on Apache needs mod_php enabled on your server.  It allows Apache to interpret .Php files.  It has Php handlers that interpret the Php code in apache and send HTML to your web server.
 If mod_php is enabled on your server, you will have a file named php.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory.  You can also check it with:
The output will be similar to:
<img decoding="async" width="682" height="506" alt="What Apache needs to Run Php File" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache3_1.jpg">
mod_phpis the oldest PHP handler, it makes PHP part of apache and does not call any external PHP process. This module is installed by default in every Linux distribution repository, so enabling/disabling this module is very easy.
If you are using FastCGI as your PHP handler, you can set multiple versions of PHP to be used by different accounts on your server.
FastCGI i.e. mod_fastcgi is an extension of mod_fcgid, where as mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative of CGI i.e. mod_cgi . It starts sufficient number of instances of CGI to handle concurrent web requests.  It also uses suexec to support different users with their own instances of PHP and improves web security. 
Running ruby files on Apache needs mod_ruby to be enabled.  Apache can also handle ruby files through FastCGI.  It is possible to use multiple version of ruby with the help of mod_fcgid i.e. FastCGI.
You can also install apache passenger and configure Apache to use it for serving ruby pages.
(Phusion Passenger also known as “passenger” is a free web server module that is designed to integrate with Apache and Nginx )
Steps to install mod_ruby on your server –
We have to add the mod_ruby module to the Apache configuration i.e. /etc/httpd/conf.d/ruby.conf and add the following line.
LoadModule ruby_module modules/mod_ruby.so
If you like to enable or disable these modules, you have to edit the apache configuration file and comment or uncomment these modules, if the web server is already compiled with these modules.
<img decoding="async" width="676" height="486" alt="Run Ruby with Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache3_2.jpg">
Securing your web server is very important, it means allowing others to see only the intended information & protecting your data and restricting access.
These are common things that enhance your Apache web servers’ security.
Apache displays its version and the name of the operating system in errors as shown in below screenshot.
<img decoding="async" width="511" height="307" alt="Hiding Apache version and OS Information" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_1.jpg">
A hacker can use this information to launch an attack using the publicly available vulnerabilities in the particular version of the server or OS.
In order to prevent Apache webserverfromdisplaying this information, we have to modify
“server signature” option available in the apache configuration file.  By default, it is “on”, we need to set it “off”. 
We have also set “ServerTokens Prod” that tells the web server to return only apache and suppress the OS major and minor version
After modifying the configuration file, you have to restart/reload your apache web server to make it effective.
<img decoding="async" width="652" height="330" alt="Hiding Apache version and OS Information" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_2.jpg">
If your document root directory does not have an index file, by default your apache web server will show all the content of the document root directory.
<img decoding="async" width="407" height="459" alt="Disable Directory Listing" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_3.jpg">
This feature could be turn off for a specific directory through “options directive” available in the Apache configuration file.
<img decoding="async" width="404" height="306" alt="Disable Directory Listing" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_4.jpg">

It is good practice to disable all unnecessary modules that are not in use.  You can see list of enabled module available in your apache configuration file –
Many of the listed modules can be disabled likemod_imap, mod_include, mod_info, mod_userdir, mod_autoindex, as they are hardly used by any production web servers.
Once you commented the module, save the file.
Restart apache services with following command.
If you like to make sure that files that is outside the web root directory are not accessible, you have to make sure that the directory is restricted with “Allow” and “Deny option” in your web server configuration file.
Once you restrict acess outside the web root directoy, you will not be able to access any file located on any other folder on your web server, you will get 404 return code.
<img decoding="async" width="795" height="481" alt="Restricting Access to Files outside the Web Root Directory" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_5.jpg">
If you like to protect your web server from Dos (i.e. Denial of Service) you must enable the module mod_evasive.  It is a third party module that detects Dos attack and prevents the attack from doing as much damage as it would do if left to run its course. It could be downloaded here.
 Download the above File
This module works as a firewall for Apache and allows you to monitor traffic in real time.  It also prevents the web server from brute force attacks. The mod_security module could be installed with the default package manager of your distribution.
<img decoding="async" width="412" height="278" alt="Using mod_security to Enhance Apache Security" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_6.jpg">
Apache does not have any restriction on the total size of the http request that could lead to a DoS attack.  You can limit the request size of an Apache directive “LimitRequestBody” with the directory tag. The value could be set anything from 0 to 2 GB (i.e. 2147483647 bytes) as per your requirement.

Apache logs provide detailed information that help to detect common issues with server.
In order create access logs, mod_log_configmodule must be enabled.
TransferLog directive is available in the apache configuration file and it rotates virtual host log files as per set parameters.
You can enable them by editing the apache configuration file i.e. apache2.conf (Debian/ubuntu) or httpd.conf (rpm based systems) file
Common Log generated by Apache
Here,
Combined Log generated by Apache:
Custom Log creates separate log file for each Virtual Host on your server.  It needs to be specified in the virtual host section of the config file.
You can see below mentioned virtual host configuration, generated log will be custom for that virtual host and the format will be combined.
<img decoding="async" width="585" height="228" alt="Combined Log Generated by Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache5_1.jpg">
1.  In order to have a running production web server, you need a dedicated node (Physical/Virtual or cloud instance) running Linux/Unix, Windows, MacOS etc. 
2.  The Web Server must have a direct network connection and a staticIP address configured on it.
3.  It needs to have all the modules required for running web pages.  If a web server processes PHP pages, it needs to have PHP  module enabled.
<img decoding="async" width="728" height="389" alt="Configure Production Web Sever" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/Network.png">
So, one can say that managing a web server for multiple domains is very complex task and requires editing hundreds of configuration file, customizing each application to fulfill the desired result.  Troubleshooting any miss configuration will be very difficult for beginners.
Cpanel provide a graphical way of managing your web server.  It is meant to provide mass hosting services that is easy to use and configure.  cPanel has reduced the technical barriers to entry into the hosting and web server management.  It makes complex task easier, it provides many useful and easy to use web interfaces that perform common system administration tasks required to operate a web server.
<img decoding="async" width="755" height="794" alt="The Solution using Cpanel or Similar Software" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache6_2.jpg">
cPanel compiles its own version of software.
 If you have to recompile your web server i.e. apache on normal Linux platform, you have to manually select/search the module that is required.  cPanel provides Easyapache functionality that is a script based web server compilation method.
<img decoding="async" width="994" height="508" alt="The Solution using Cpanel or Similar Software" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache6_3.jpg">
 It not only provides you web services but also Mail, DNS, FTP and many more services that is required for your web application.
A task that needs expertise on core Linux/Unix based hosting like installing SSLs, recompiling Apache with different PHP modules, updating Web Security, configuring effective IPTABLE rules, Adding ftp users, creating mail accounts for each domain, scanning your document root with antivirus and creating databases are easy to complete with cPanel.
It provides a lot of scripts that fixes, install and troubleshoot common administrative tasks.
It provides a backup and restore functionality eliminating the need to manually copy files to backup storage.  If you are backing up your domain, cPanel will create a tar file that will contain document root folder, email accounts and mails, ftp accounts, databases, DNS records and other applications.
It also provides a robust documentation, andhas a very big community of users where you could discuss and get solution of your issues.
So, one can say that cPanel is a best application for managing your web server with required features.  It provides you, easy to use interface for managing your domain and a mechanism to avoid complexity of managing core Web Server.
There are many competing products to cPanel like Plesk, ISPConfig, Ajenti, Kloxo, Open Panel, Zpanel etc.

Kotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It combines Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) and functional programming in unrestricted, self-sufficient, and distinctive platforms. It also allows the twinning of functionalities by miniature codes. Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language which was designed by JetBrains.
Here, are important landmarks from the history of Kotlin:
Here, are some important reasons why Kotlin is used widely:
Here are a few features of the Kotlin that will make you sure of the progress path of the programming language.
Kotlin is an OOPs-based programming language where code line can be trimmed up to 40 % that which makes Kotlin an ideal choice for software or web development.
Kotlin for Android utilizes JVM and combines the features of OOPs and functional-oriented programming.
it is easy to compile the code when working with Kotlin that results in better performance for android development, and it will also explain which type of data function can be used in the entire code.
Kotlin can support a variety of extension functions without making any changes to the code. it helps in making existing code more appealing and magnificent for developers.
For Example:
This code will assist in trimming down the first and the last character of the string, we can apply it as:
In Kotlin, the system distinguishes between null references and not null references as shown in below Kotlin example.
For example, a String variable cannot hold null:
Kotlin code can be used by Java, and Java codes can be used with Kotlin. So, if you have knowledge about OOPs programming, it is easy to switch to Kotlin’s development. Also, if there are some applications written in Java, then they can be used with Kotlin’s environment.
Like Java, Kotlin code can also be written using IDE or using the command-line interface. It is easy to work with IDE, and syntax errors are also reduced dramatically. At the same time, when you are working with a command-line interface, code has to be compiled first.
Smart casting basically helps to cut down the application costs and improves its speed or performance. It works on managing the efficiency of code using type casting or immutable values.
For example, if the string is identified, then it’s length and count and can be found with the help of Smart Cast function:
Kotlin is preferred by enterprises because of its lost cost of adoption. Most importantly, it is easy to learn by developers, especially having a programming background.
Following are the steps which help you in setting up a working environment by installing Kotlin.
As we have discussed earlier that Kotlin is based on Java, so you have to install Java first when planning to adopt Kotlin. Refer our Java Installation Tutorial.
Luckily, there are multiple Java IDEs to choose from. Here we have given download links to make things a little easier for you.
In this Kotlin tutorial, we will use Eclipse.
For Installing Kotlin in Eclipse, go to the Help section in Eclipse and click the Eclipse Marketplace option.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="313" height="363" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor1.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Now, Type the Kotlin keyword into the search box. Click on Go option to list the plugin. It will give you a link of Kotlin plug-in, you need to install the plug-in from the given link.
<img decoding="async" width="575" height="406" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor2.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Please restart the Eclipse IDE, once the installation is complete. You can find a shortcut icon in the top right corner of Eclipse IDE. It is a quick access method.
<img decoding="async" width="242" height="93" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor3.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Another way of accessing Kotlin in Eclipse IDE is, go to the Windows, Perspectives, Open Perspectives, then choose Others option. Here, you can check a list of plugins installed later, as given below.
<img decoding="async" width="328" height="203" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor4.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Once, you have verified the Kotlin installation, let us create the first Kotlin program in the next step.
Start with your first Kotlin project. From the File menu, choose the New option, then select others and start with a new Kotlin project from the list.
<img decoding="async" width="519" height="146" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor5.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Now, you have to define a name for the project, and you are ready to work with Kotlin.
<img decoding="async" width="597" height="324" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor6.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
With these simple steps, it is easy downloading Eclipse and Kotlin on your system and write your first Kotlin program right away.
A well-built architecture is important for an application to scale up its features and meet the expectations of the end-user base. Kotlin has its own peculiar and distinctive architecture to allocate the memory and to get quality outcomes for the developers and end-users.
Kotlin’s coroutines and classes architect the core in such a way to produce less boilerplate code, amplify the performance, and reinforce the efficiency. There are a variety of scenarios where the kotlin compiler can react differently, especially whenever it is earmarking various kinds of languages.






In the architecture diagram, it is clear that code execution is done in three easy steps.
When a couple of byte coded file operates on JVM, they kindle the mutual communication among themselves, which is why the feature in Kotlin called interoperability for java ook birth
The transpiring of Kotlin to JavaScript happens when Kotlin targets JavaScript.
When the JavaScript’s target is chosen, any code of Kotlin that is a part of the library that sails with Kotlin is than spilled with JavaScript. However, the Java Development Kit(JDK) or any java library used is excluded.
A non-Kotlin file is not taken into consideration during such operation. While targeting JavaScript .kt file is converted into ES5.1 by Kotlin compiler to generate a consistent code for JavaScript. Kotlin compiler endeavors an optimal size output, interoperability with existing module, same functionality with the standard library, and output that is JavaScript readable.
It is clear from the discussion that Kotlin Compilers can create a more efficient, competent, and independent code that further results in a high-performing software product.
Variables are used to store data to be manipulated and referenced in the program. It is fundamentally a unit of storing data and labeling it waits for an expository alias so that the program is simple to read and easy to understand. In other words, we can say that variables are the containers to collect information.
In Kotlin, all the variables should be declared. However, if any variable is not declared, then it pops out to be a syntax error. Also, the declaration of the variable determines the type of data we are allowing to store in the variable. In Kotlin, variables can be defined using val and var keywords. Here is the syntax of declaring variables in Kotlin:
Here, we have declared the local variable day whose value is “Monday’ and whose type is String and another local variable number whose value is 3 and whose type is Int because here the literal is of the type integer that is 3.
Local variables are customarily declared and initialized simultaneously. We can also perform certain operations while initializing the Kotlin variable.
We can perform an operation on the variable of the same data type, as in here num1 and num2 both are of the same data type that is Int, whereas day is of the string data type. Ergo, it will show an error. Here is one another technique how can you define variables in Kotlin.
Let see how var and val keywords are different from each other.
Var is like a generic variable used in any programming language that can be utilized multiple times in a single program. Moreover, you can change its value anytime in a program. Therefore, it is known as the mutable variable.
Here is an example of mutable variable in Kotlin:
Here the value of num1 that is 20, is overwritten by the previous value of num1 that is 10. Therefore the output of num1 + num2 is 40 instead of 30.
Val is like a constant variable, and you cannot change its value later in the program, which neither can be assigned multiple times in a single program and can be used only once in a particular program. Ergo, it is known as an immutable variable.
Here is an Kotlin program example of immutable variables in Kotlin:
Here, the value of num1 that is 10 cannot be overwritten by the new value of num1 that is 20, as it is of val type that is constant. Therefore, the output is 30 instead of 40.
Note: In Kotlin, immutable variables are preferred over mutable variables.
Data types are set of relatable values and describe the operations that can be operated on them. Similar to other programming languages, Kotlin also has its predefined set of data types like Int, Boolean, Char, Double, etc.
In Kotlin, every data type is considered as an object.
Now in this Kotlin basic Tutorial, let’s dive deeper into the predefined data types used in Kotlin.
Kotlin serves a set of built-in data types known as numbers, which are sub-categorize as Integers and Floating-Point Numbers.
Integers are the category of numbers that has four types:
Floating Point Numbers are the non-Integer numbers that carry some decimal values.
Float: Float is a 32- bit single-precision floating-point value.
Example: var: Float x = 3.25600
Double: Double is a 64- bit double – precision floating point value.
Example: var: Double y = 2456.345587
Booleans data type in Kotlin is significant to represent the logical values. There are only two possible values in Boolean that is either true or false.
For Example: val day = true
Val day2 = false
Characters in Kotlin are represented with the help of the keyword called char. In Kotlin, single quotes represent the declaration of char. In java, char are sometimes used as numbers that is not possible in kotlin.
For Example:
Type Conversion is a procedure of converting one type of data variable into another data type variable. It is enormously, also known as Type Casting.
Eminently, in Java, implicit type of type conversion or implicit type of typecasting of a smaller data type to larger data type is supported.
However, in kotlin, implicit conversion of a smaller data type to a larger data type is not at all supported that is int data type cannot be converted into long data type implicitly.
However, In Kotlin, type conversion is done explicitly. Here comes the guidance of helper functions that guides the conversion of one data type variable to another.
There are certain helper function which are pre – owned for the conversion of one data type to another :
toInt()
toByte()
toShort()
toChar()
toLong()
toFloat()
toDouble()
Operators are momentous and special characters or symbols that assures the operations in operands that have variables and values. In Kotlin, there is a set of operators that are used in different operations like arithmetic operations, assignment operations, comparison operations, etc.
Arithmetic operators are used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
For Example:
Here the output of the following code is 45.
Comparison operator is used to compare two values, two variables or two numbers. It is used with the greater than symbol( > ), less than symbol( < ) and equal to symbol( ==), not equal to symbol( != ), greater than equal to symbol( >= ), less than equal to symbol(<= ). It always results in true or false.
For Example:
Assignment Operators are used to assign the arithmetic operated values. It is used with the symbols like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
For Example:
Increment and decrement operators are used to increment and decrement the values of the variable or number. It is used with the help of symbols like ++ and —.
There are two types of increment and decrement that are pre-increment ++a, post-increment a++, pre decrement –b, post decrement b–.
For Example:
An Array is the homogenous set of data types and is one of the most fundamental data types which is used to store the same types of data in the contiguous memory location. An Array is significant for the organization of data in any programming language so that multiple data stored ant a single place is easy to search or sort.
In Kotlin, arrays are a mutable collaboration of the same data types rather than being native data types.
Here are certain properties of an array in Kotlin
In Kotlin, an array can be defined in two different methods
In Kotlin, there is a major usage of library functions. One such library function is arrayOf() function, which is used to define an array by passing the values of the variables to the function.
For Example: Implicit type declaration of array using arrayOf() function
For Example: Explicitly type declaration of array using arrayOf() function.
In Kotlin, there is a class with the name of Array. Therefore, it is feasible to use an array of the constructor to create an array. The array in constructor holds two major parameters.
The function where an array index is acceptable to return the initial value of the index.
For Example:
Here, the value of array is 7 and lambda expression is used to initialize the values of the element.
There are also various methods to access and modify the arrays using certain functions. Therefore, there are two member functions get() and set(), which are used to access class array’s objects.
For Example:
Here, the output is 10 since the value at the index 0 of array is 10
Note : get() takes only single values
For Example:
Output : 30 40
Here, the output is 30 and 40 since the value at the index 2 of array is 30 and at index 3 it is 40.
Note: set() takes multiple values of an array.
A string is a basic data type in any programming language. A string is nothing but a sequence of characters. The String class represents character strings. In Kotlin, all strings are objects of the String class, which means string literals are implemented as instances of the class.
Syntax:
A collection contains several objects of a similar type, and these objects in the collection are called elements or items. Collection can help to store, retrieve, manipulate, and aggregate data.
Immutable collection
This type of collection support read-only functionalities. One cannot modify its elements.
Methods include:
Mutable Collection
It supports both read and write functionality.
Methods include
Functions in any programming language is a group of similar statements which is designated to perform a specific task. Functions allow a program to break it into various small code blocks. This division of code increases the readability of code, reusability of code, and makes a program easy to manage.
As Kotlin is known as a statically typed language. Here, the ‘fun’ keyword is used to declare a function. In Kotlin, there are two types of functions which solely depends upon its availability in the standard library or user definition. They are:





Now, let us discuss them in detail with Kotlin code examples.
They are built-in library functions that can be defined implicitly and available for use.
For Example 2:
Output:
3.0
sqrt() is a function defined in the library which returns the square root of a number.
print() function prints message to a standard output stream.
As the name suggests, these functions are usually created by users, and they can be used for advanced programming.
Here, functions are declared using the ‘fun’ keyword.
For Example 3:
Here, we call the function to run codes inside the body functionName()
Kotlin function examples:
Output:
sum = 17
code after sum
Exception in programming is defined as a runtime problem which occurs in the program, leading it to terminate. This issue can occur due to less memory space, array out of bond, conditions like division by zero. To curb these types of issues in code execution, exception handling is used.
Exception handling is defined as the technique which handles the runtime problems and also maintains the program flow during execution.
Kotlin uses the ‘throw’ expression to throw an exception object. Here all exception classes are descendants of class Throwable.
Throw MyException(“throws exception”)
There are four types of exceptions in exception handling. They are:
In try-catch block in exception handling, try block encloses the code, which may throw an exception and catch block catches the expression and handles it.
Syntax of try catch block:
Syntax of try with finally block
In Kolin, finally block always checks whether the exception is handled or not, making it a very important statement of exception handling.
For Example 4:
In this code snippet, the exception occurs, and it is handled.
Output:
Throw block throws an explicit exception. Moreover, it is used to throw custom exceptions.
Syntax:
Example:
Output:

The types of systems that support Kotlin majorly distinguishes among the references that can carry nullable references, and the ones cannot carry nullable references. Kotlin is a null safety language aimed to eliminate the null pointer exception or null reference from the code, which is deliberately known as A Billion Dollar Mistake.
The most conventional stumbling block of many programming languages is that while accessing a member of a null reference, it results to be a NullPointerException, which could be because of !! operator or this constructor used somewhere else and passed at another point of code. The nullable property requires confirmation for the null check every time prior to its utilization.
In Kotlin, the system distinguishes between null references and not null references.
For example, a String variable cannot hold null:
For Example 5:
Output:
<img decoding="async" width="879" height="104" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor10.png" alt="Kotlin Null Safety">
The object-oriented programming approach allows a complex code snippet to divide into smaller code blocks by creating objects. These objects mutually share two characteristics: state and behavior.
Here are some of the OOPs elements that we are going to discuss with Kotlin code examples:
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="130" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor11.png" alt="Kotlin OOPs">
The first before creating an object, we need to define a class that is also known as the blueprint for the object.
Syntax:
While defining a class, we only define the specifications for the object, no other parameter like memory or storage is allocated.
Syntax:
A constructor is a way to initialize class properties. It’s a member function called when an object is instantiated. But in Kotlin, it works differently.
There are two types of constructors in Kotlin:






Primary constructor: Optimized way to initialize a class
Syntax:
Secondary constructor: Helps to add initialization logic 
Inheritance occurs when some properties of the parent class are acquired by the child class. Inheritance is allowed when two or more classes have the same properties.
Syntax:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but we can inherit subclasses from them. ‘abstract ‘ keyword is used to declare an abstract class.
For Example 6:
Output:

MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL database management system. It is created by its original developers. This DBMS tool offers data processing capabilities for both small and enterprise tasks.
MariaDB is an improved version of MySQL. It comes with numerous inbuilt powerful features and many usabilities, security and performance improvements that you cannot find in MySQL.
Here are the features of MariaDB:

Step 12) Congratulations!
You now have MariaDB installed on your computer.
Now that you have MariaDB installed on your computer, it is time for you to launch it and begin to use it. This can be done via the MariaDB command prompt.
Follow the steps given below:
Step 1) Click Start, choose All Programs then click MariaDB…
Step 2) Choose a MariaDB Command Prompt.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto9.png" alt="MariaDB Command Prompt" width="412" height="366">
Step 3) The MariaDB command prompt will be started. It is now time to login. You should login as the root user and the password that you set during the installation of MariaDB. Type the following command on the command prompt:
Step 4) Enter the password and hit the return key. You should be logged in, as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto10.png" alt="MariaDB Command Prompt" width="671" height="218">
You are now logged into MariaDB.
MariaDB supports the following data types:
These include the following:
They include the following:
These include the following:
They include the following:
To create a new database in MariaDB, you should have special privileges which are only granted to the root user and admins.
To create a new database, you should use the CREATE DATABASE command which takes the following syntax:
In this case, you need to create a database and give it the name Demo.
Start the MariaDB command prompt and login as the root user by typing the following command:
Type the root password and hit the return key. You will be logged in.
Now, run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto11.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="331" height="60">
You have then created a database named Demo. It will be good for you to confirm whether the database was created successfully or not. You only have to show the list of the available databases by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto12.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="285" height="163">
The above output shows that the Demo database is part of the list, hence the database was created successfully.
For you to be able to use or work on a particular database, you have to select it from the list of the available databases. After selecting a database, you can perform tasks such as creating tables within the database.
To select a database, you should use the USE command. It takes the syntax given below:
You need to use the Demo database. You can select it by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto13.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="238" height="49">
The above image shows that the MariaDB command prompt has changed from none to the name of the database that has been selected.
You can now go ahead and create tables within the Demo database.
For you to be able to create a table, you must have selected a database. The table can be created using the CREATE TABLE statement. Here is the syntax for the command:
You can set one of the columns to be the primary key. This column should not allow null values.
We will create two tables within the Demo database, Book, and Price tables. Each table will have two columns.
Let’s begin by creating the Book table with two columns, id and name. Run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto14.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="320" height="93">
The PRIMARY KEY constraint has been used to set the id column as the primary key for the table. The AUTO_INCREMENT property will increment the values of the id column by 1 automatically for each new record inserted into the table. All the columns will not allow null values.
Now, create the second table, the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto15.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="325" height="94">
The id column has been set as the primary key for the table.
Now that you have created the two tables, it will be good for you to conform whether the tables were created successfully or not. You can show the list of tables contained in a database by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto16.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="250" height="128">
The above screenshot shows that the two tables were created successfully within the Demo database.
To see the structure of any particular table, you can use the DESCRIBE command, commonly abbreviated as DESC. It takes the following syntax:
For example, to see the structure of the table named Book, you can run the following command;
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto17.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="526" height="131">
The table has two columns. To see the structure of the Price table, you can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto18.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="486" height="132">
To insert data into a MariaDB table, you should use the INSERT INTO statement. This command takes the syntax given below:
The above syntax shows that you have to specify the table columns into which you want to insert data as well as the data that you need to insert.
Let us insert a record into the Book table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto19.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="304" height="85">
You have inserted a single record into the table. Insert a record into the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto20.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="305" height="87">
The record has been created.
The SELECT statement helps us to view or see the contents of a database table. To see the contents of the Book table, for example, you need to run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto21.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="298" height="121">
Now, view the contents of the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto22.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="303" height="122">
It is possible for us to insert multiple records into a MariaDB table at a go. To demonstrate this, run the following example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto23.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="329" height="145">
You can query the table to check whether the records were inserted successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto24.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="288" height="166">
The records were inserted successfully. Insert multiple records into the Price table by running this example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto25.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="322" height="140">
Let’s confirm whether the records were created successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto26.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="304" height="166">
The UPDATE command helps us to change or modify the records that have already been inserted into a table. You can combine it with the WHERE clause to specify the record that is to be updated. Here is the syntax:
The UPDATE command can also be combined with clauses such as SET, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY. You will see this shortly:
Consider the table named Price with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto27.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="304" height="166">
Let’s change the price of the book with an id of 1 from 200 to 250:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto28.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="336" height="95">
The command ran successfully. You can now query the table to see whether the change took place:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto29.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="301" height="167">
The above screenshot shows that the change has been implemented. Consider the table Book with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto30.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="302" height="170">
Let us change the name of the book named Book to MariaDB Book1. Notice that the book has an id of 1. Here is the command for this:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto31.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="335" height="95">
Check whether the change has been implemented:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto32.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="294" height="164">
The above screenshot shows that the change has been implemented successfully.
In the above examples, we have only changed one column at a time. However, it is possible for us to change multiple columns at a go. Let us demonstrate this using an example.
Let us use the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto33.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="300" height="166">
Let us change both the id and the price of the book with an id of 5. We will change its id to 6 and price to 6. Run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto34.png" alt="  CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="335" height="103">
Now, query the table to check whether the change was made successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto35.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="307" height="167">
The change was made successfully.
We use the DELETE command when we need to delete either one or many records from a table. Here is the syntax for the command:
Consider the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto36.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="307" height="167">
We need to delete the last record from the table. It has an id of 6 and a price of 280. Let us delete the record:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto37.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="306" height="68">
The command ran successfully. Let us query the table to confirm whether the deletion was successful:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto38.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="304" height="150">
The output shows that the record was deleted successfully.
The WHERE clause helps us to specify the exact location where we need to make a change. It is used together with statements such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Consider the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto39.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="304" height="150">
Suppose we need to see the records in which the price is less than 250. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto40.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="232" height="154">
All the records in which the price is below 250 have been returned.
The WHERE clause can be combined with the AND statement. Suppose we need to see all records in the Price table where the price is below 250 and id is above 3. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto41.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="222" height="158">
Only one record has been returned. The reason is that it has to meet all the conditions that have been specified, that is, id above 3 and price below 250. If any of these conditions is violated, then the record will not be returned.
The clause can also be combined with the OR command. Let us replace the AND in our previous command with OR and see the kind of output that we receive:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto42.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="214" height="162">
We now get 2 records rather than 1. This is because, for a record of qualifying, it only has to meet one of the specified conditions.
This clause is used to specify the data pattern when accessing table data in which an exact match is necessary. It can be combined with the INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT and DELETE statements.
You should pass the pattern of data you are looking for to the clause, and it will return either true or false. Here are the wildcard characters that can be used together with the clause:
Here is the syntax for the LIKE clause:
Let us demonstrate how to use the clause with the % wildcard character. Let us use the Book table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto43.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="296" height="165">
We need to see all records in which the name begins with M. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto44.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="237" height="189">
All records have been returned because their names begin with the letter M. To see all names that end with 4, you can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto45.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="246" height="140">
Only one name has been returned because it’s the only one meeting the condition.
We can also surround the search pattern by the wildcard:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto46.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="252" height="187">
Other than the % wildcard, the LIKE clause can be used together with the _ wildcard. This is the underscore wildcard, and it will only look for a single character.
Let’s work with the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto47.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="302" height="151">
Let us check for the record in which the price is like 1_0. We run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto48.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="251" height="141">
It has returned the record in which the price is 190. We can also try another pattern:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto49.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="250" height="141">
It is possible for us to use the LIKE clause together with the NOT operator. This will return all the records that don’t meet the specified pattern. For example:
Let us use the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto50.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="294" height="148">
Let us find all the records where the price does not start with 2:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto51.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="279" height="141">
Only one record does not meet the specified pattern.
This clause helps us to sort out our records in either ascending or descending order. We use it with the SELECT statement, as shown below:
It is possible for us to use this clause without adding either the ASC or DESC part. For example:
We will use the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto52.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="298" height="150">
Run the following command against the table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto53.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="296" height="164">
In the above command, we have ordered by the price. The records have been ordered with the prices in ascending order. That means that when we don’t specify the order, the sorting is done in ascending order by default.
Let us run the clause with the DESC option:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto54.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="295" height="165">
The records have been sorted with the price in descending order as we have specified.
Let us use the ORDER BY clause together with the ASC attribute:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto55.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="294" height="162">
The records have been ordered but with the prices in ascending order. This is similar to when we use the ORDER BY clause without either ASC or DESC attributes.
This clause helps us to do away with duplicates when selecting records from a table. This means that it helps us get unique records. Its syntax is given below:
To demonstrate this, we will use the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto56.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="301" height="151">
When we select the price column from the table, we get the following result:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto57.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="338" height="153">
We have two records with a price of 250, creating a duplicate. We need to have only unique records. We can filter these by use of the DISTINCT clause as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto58.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="400" height="146">
We now don’t have any duplicates in the above output.
The FROM clause used for fetching data from a database table. It can also help when joining tables. Here is the syntax for the command:
To see the contents of the book table, run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto59.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-From" width="300" height="152">
The clause can help you to fetch only a single column from a database table. For example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto60.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-From" width="328" height="153">
A procedure is a MariaDB program that you can pass parameters to. A procedure doesn’t return values. To create a procedure, we use the CREATE PROCEDURE command.
To demonstrate how to create and call a procedure, we will create a procedure named myProcedure() that helps us select the name column from the book table. Here is the procedure:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto61.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="408" height="113">
The procedure has been created. We have simply enclosed the SELECT statement within the BEGIN and END clauses of the procedure.
Now, we can call the procedure by its name as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto62.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="317" height="201">
The procedure returns the name column of the book table when called.
We can create a procedure that takes in a parameter. For example, we need to select the name of the book and filter using the book id. We can create the following procedure for this:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto63.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="509" height="115">
Above, we have created a procedure named myProcedure2(). This procedure takes one integer parameter named book_id which is the id of the book whose name we need to see. To see the name of the book with an id of 3, we can call the procedure as follows:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto64.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="311" height="152">
Unlike procedures, we must pass parameters to functions and a function must return a value. To create a function in MariaDB, we use the CREATE FUNCTION statement. The statement takes the following syntax:
The above parameters are described below:
Here is an example MariaDB function:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto65.png" alt="Function in MariaDB" width="410" height="252">
We can then call the above function as follows:
The command will return the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto66.png" alt="Function in MariaDB" width="304" height="113">
Once you are done with a function, it will be good for you to delete it. This is easy as you only have to call the DROP FUNCTION statement that takes the following syntax:
For example, to drop the function named myFunc, we can run the following command:
When you need to retrieve data from more than one tables at a go, use MariaDB JOINS. This means that a JOIN works on two or more tables. The following three types of JOINS are supported in MariaDB:
Let us discuss them one-by-one:
The inner join returns all rows from the tables in which the join condition is true. Its syntax is as follows:
For example:
We will use our two tables, books, and book.
The book table has the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto67.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="290" height="159">
The Price table has the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto68.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="300" height="149">
The goal is to join the name column from the Book table and the price column from Price table into a single table. This is possible with an inner join, as demonstrated below:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto69.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="376" height="189">
This join returns all the rows from the left-hand table and only rows in which the join condition is true from the other table. Its syntax is as follows:
The OUTER keyword has been placed within square brackets because it is optional.
For example:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto70.png" alt="LEFT OUTER JOIN" width="369" height="197">
The last record in the above table has no matching value on the left. That is why it has been replaced with NULL.
This join returns all the rows from the right-hand table and only rows in which the join condition is true from the other table. Its syntax is as follows:
The OUTER keyword has been placed within square brackets because it is optional.
For example:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto71.png" alt="RIGHT OUTER JOIN" width="372" height="188">
The reason is that all rows in the right-hand table were matched to those in the other table. If some of the rows did not match, we would have NULLs in the first column.

ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is very easy to use, and it allows users to create reusable UI components.
JSX : JSX is an extension to javascript. Though it is not mandatory to use JSX in react, it is one of the good features and easy to use.
Components: Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code. We can use components as functions and components as classes. Components also have a state, props which makes life easy. Inside a class, the state of each of the props is maintained.
Virtual DOM: React creates a virtual dom, i.e., in-memory data -structure cache. Only the final changes of DOM has later updated in the browsers DOM.
Javascript Expressions: JS expressions can be used in the jsx files using curly brackets, for example {}.
Here, are important pros/benefits of using ReactJS:
Here, are cons/ drawbacks of using ReactJS:
To start working with react, we need to first install reactjs. You can easily get started to use reactjs by using the CDN javascript files, as shown below.
Go to the official site of reactjs to get the CDN links, i.e., https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html and you will get the required files to explain the following image.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="936" height="625" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto1.png" alt="Using ReactJS from CDN">
Replace version with the latest react version for both react-development.js and react-dom.developement.js. You can host the files at your end to start working with reactjs.
In case if you are planning to use the CDN files, make sure to keep the cross-origin attribute, to avoid cross-domain issues. Reactjs code cannot be executed directly in the browser and needs to be transpired using Babel to javascript before executing in the browser.
Here is the BabelJS script that can be used:
Here is the working ReactJS example using cdn files and babeljs script.
Output:
<img decoding="async" width="494" height="123" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto2.png" alt="For prod Output">
We will get into the details of the code in the next chapter, let us see the working here with CDN files. It is said that using babel script directly is not a good practice, and newcomers can just use it to learn reactjs for now. In production, you will have to install react using npm package.
Make sure you have nodejs installed.  If not installed, go through this tutorial for nodejs (https://www.guru99.com/node-js-tutorial.html) installation.
Once you have nodejs installed, create a folder reactproj/.
To start with project setup, run command npm init.
This is how the folder structure will look like:
Now we will install the packages that we need.
Here are the list of packages for reactjs:
Open the command prompt and run above commands inside the folder reactproj/.
Create a folder src/ where all the js code will come in that folder. All the code for reactjs project will be available in the src/ folder. Create a file index.js and add import react and react-dom, as shown below.
index.js
We have returned the basic code for reactjs. We will explain the details of it in the next chapter. We want to display Hello, from Guru99 Tutorials and the same is given to the dom element with id “root”.It is taken from the index.html file, which is the start file, as shown below.
Create a folder public/ and add index.html in that as shown below
index.html
The package react-scripts will take care of compiling the code and starting the server to display the html file i.e index.html. You need to add the command in package.json that will take care of using react-scripts to compile the code and start server as shown below:
After installing all the packages and adding the above command, the final package.json is as follows:
Package.json
To start testing reactjs run the command
It will open browser with url http://localhost:3000/  as shown below:
public/index.html
<img decoding="async" width="559" height="183" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto3.png" alt="Using NPM Packages">
We are going to use the same process to execute the javascript files in the next chapters too. Add all your js and .jsx file in src/ folder .The file structure will be as follows:
Here is a step by step guide in this ReactJS Tutorial to start with the first react application.
Step 1) Import the react packages.
1. To start with ReactJS, we need to first import the react packages as follows.
2. Save the file as index.js in src/ folder
Step 2) Write Simple Code.
We will write a simple code in this tutorial React JS, wherein we will display the message “Hello, from Guru99 Tutorials!”
ReactDOM.render will add the <h1> tag to the element with id root. Here is the html file we are having:
Step 3) Compile the Code.
Next in this React.js Tutorial, we need to compile the code to get the output in the browser.
Here is the folder structure:
We have added the commands to compile the final file in package.json as follows:
To compile the final file  run following command:
When you run above command, it will compile the files and notify you if any error, if all looks good, it will open the browser and the run the index.html file at http://localhost:3000/index.html
Command: npm run start:
Step 4) Check Output.
The URL http://localhost:3000 will open in  the browser once the code is compiled as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="559" height="183" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto4.png" alt="Output of First React Project">
JSX is an extension to javascript. It is a template script where you will have the power of using HTML and Javascript together.
Here is a simple example of a JSX code.
For a UI, we need Html, and each element in the dom will have events to be handled, state changes, etc.
In case of React, it allows us to make use of Html and javascript in the same file and take care of the state changes in the dom in an efficient manner.
Here is a simple example of how to use expressions in JSX.
In earlier ReactJS examples, we had written something like :
index.js
We will now change the above code to add expressions. Expressions are used inside curly brackets {}, and they are expanded during run time. Expressions in react are the same as javascript expressions.
index.js
Let us now test the same in the browser.
<img decoding="async" width="295" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto5.png" alt="Expressions in JSX Output">
You can see that the {display} expression is not replaced. React does not know what to do when an expression is used inside the .js file.
Let us now add changes and create a .jsx file, as shown below:
test.jsx
We have added the required code and will use the text.jsx file in index.js.We want the h1tag variable to be used inside script.js, so the same is exported as shown above in the test.jsx
Here is the modified code in index.js


We can use the h1tag now in the ReactDOM.render as shown below:
Here is the output when we check the same in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="406" height="145" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto6.png" alt="Output">
Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code.
test.jsx


The Component Hello is used as an Html tag, i.e., <Hello /> and assigned to Hello_comp variable and the same is exported using export.
Let us now use this component in index.js file as shown below:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="427" height="129" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto7.png" alt="Output of Components in ReactJS">
Here is a ReactJS example that uses a class as a component.
test.jsx
We can use Hello component in index.js file as follows:
index.js
The Component Hello is used as an Html tag i.e., <Hello />.
Here is the output of the same.
<img decoding="async" width="448" height="169" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto8.png" alt="Class as Component Output">
A state is a javascript object similar to props that have data to be used with the reactjs render. The state data is a private object and is used within components inside a class.
Here is a working example on how to use state inside a class.
test.jsx
index.js
This is what we get when we test it in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="478" height="116" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto9.png" alt="State in ReactJS Output">
Props are properties to be used inside a component. They act as global object or variables which can be used inside the Component.
Here is an example of passing props to a function component.
As shown above, we have added msg attribute to <Hello /> Component. The same can be accessed as props inside Hello function, which is an object that will have the msg attribute details, and the same is used as an expression.
The component is used in index.js as follows:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="604" height="141" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto10.png" alt="Props to Function Component Output">
To access the props in a class we can do it as follows:
test.jsx
The msg attribute is passed to the component in index.js as follows:
This is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="479" height="135" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto11.png" alt="Props to Class Component Output">

A component life cycle is divided into Initialization, Mounting, Update, and UnMounting stages.
Here is a detail explanation about each Component.
A component in reactjs has the following stages :
Initialization: This is the first stage of the component life cycle.
Here it will have the default props and the state at the initial level.
Mounting: In this phase, the Component is rendered inside the dom. We having exposure to following methods in the mounting state.
Update: In this state, the dom is interacted by a user and updated. For example, you enter something in the textbox, so the state properties are updated.
Following are the methods available in update state:
UnMounting: this state comes into the picture when the Component is not required or removed.
Following are the methods available in unmount state:
Component willUnmount(): called when the Component is removed or destroyed.
Here is a working example which shows the methods called at each state.
Example: complife.jsx
index.js
When you check the output in the browser
<img decoding="async" width="351" height="161" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto12.png" alt="Output">
In browser console you get :
<img decoding="async" width="524" height="23" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto13.png" alt="Browser Console Output">
When the user enters in the textbox:
<img decoding="async" width="395" height="163" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto14.png" alt="User Values Output">
In console following messages are displayed:
<img decoding="async" width="519" height="314" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto15.png" alt="Console Output">
In reactjs Html  input elements like <input />, <textarea /> and <select /> has their own state and needs to be updated when user interacts using the setState() method.
In this chapter, we will see how to work with forms in reactjs.
Here is a working example:
form.jsx
For the input fields, we need to maintain the state, so for that react provides a special method called setState, which helps to maintain the state whenever there is a change.
We have used events onChange and onClick on the textbox and submit button. When the user enters inside the textbox the onChange event  is called, and the name field inside state object state is updated as shown below:
index.js
The output in the browser is as follows:
<img decoding="async" width="375" height="143" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto16.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
Step 1) Enter your name in the textbox:
<img decoding="async" width="450" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto17.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
<img decoding="async" width="450" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto18.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
Working with events in reactjs is same as how you would have done in javascript. You can use all the event handlers that are used in javascript. The setState() method is used to update the state when the user interacts with any Html element.
Here is a working example of how to use events in reactjs.
events.jsx
For the input fields, we need to maintain the state, so for that react provides a special method called setState, which helps to maintain the state whenever there is a change.
We have used events onChange and onClick on the textbox and button. When the user enters inside the textbox the onChange event  is called, and the name field inside state object  state is updated as shown below:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="362" height="128" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto19.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
When a user enters the name :
<img decoding="async" width="419" height="176" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto20.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
When the user clicks on the Click Here button:
<img decoding="async" width="449" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto21.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
Will take a look at a working example to understand the working of inline css in reactjs.
addstyle.jsx
I have added color: ‘red’ style to the h1 tag.
index.js
The output in the browser is as follows:
<img decoding="async" width="505" height="161" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto22.png" alt="Working with Inline CSS Output">
You can create an object of style that you want on the element and use an expression to add style, as shown in the example above.
Let us create a external css , for that create a folder css/ and add style.css in it.
style.css
Add the style.css to your index.html file
Now let us add the class to the h1 tag in .jsx file
addstyle.jsx
index.js
The className attribute is given the class details. Now let us test in the browser.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="190" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto23.png" alt="Working with External CSS Output">
This is what you see when you inspect the h1 tag in browser:
<img decoding="async" width="449" height="150" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto24.png" alt="Working with External CSS Output">
You can see that the class=” h1tag” is added successfully to the h1 tag.

Web services is a standardized way or medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web. This course will give a detailed insight into various components of web services like SOAP, WSDL, REST, and how they operate.
This course is designed for beginners having basic knowledge of web services protocols and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) principles.
Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web.
Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other
Popular Web Services Protocols are:
SOAP is known as the Simple Object Access Protocol.
SOAP was developed as an intermediate language so that applications built on various programming languages could talk quickly to each other and avoid the extreme development effort.
WSDL is known as the Web Services Description Language(WSDL).
WSDL is an XML-based file which tells the client application what the web service does and gives all the information required to connect to the web service.
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
REST is used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable.

Microsoft Access is a Database Management System offered by Microsoft. It uses the Microsoft Jet Database Engine and comes as a part of the Microsoft Office suite of application.
Microsoft Access offers the functionality of a database and the programming capabilities to create easy to navigate screens (forms). It helps you analyze large amounts of information, and manage data efficiently.
Now in this Microsoft Access tutorial, we will learn about some important terms and basic objects in MS Access:
It is a file which stores the entire database. The database file is saved to your hard drive or other storage devices. 
Datatypes are the properties of each field.  Every field has one datatype like text, number, date, etc. 
Macros are mini computer programming constructs. They allow you to set up commands and processes in your forms, like, searching, moving to another record, or running a formula.
Modules are procedures(functions) which you can write using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
MS Access common data types are listed below:
Microsoft Access and Excel are very similar yet very different. Here, are some important difference points between both of them-

Before we create a Database, lets quickly understand the holistic picture of what Database is, with particular reference to MS Access.
Let’s, start with a few real-life Microsoft Access databases example:
Similarly, we have MS Access Database is a kind of home for all your Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports, etc. in MS Access which are interlinked. 
Technically, Database store the data in a well-organized manner for easy access and retrieval.

Ruby is a high-level, interpreted and object-oriented programming language. It is a dynamic open-source language that has a great community behind it. Ruby was designed for simplicity and productivity. It encourages writing human first and computer second software code. It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan in 1995.
Rails is a development framework written in Ruby for building web applications. It was created as the foundation of Basecamp application and then released as an open-source software in 2004. Rails offers many in-built standard features and functionalities, which makes it a suitable option for MVP prototyping and development.
It was created by David Heinemeier Hasson popularly known as DHH. It is one of the most influential and popular tools for building web applications. It is used by some of the favourite sites like Airbnb, Github, Shopify, etc.
Here are pros/ benefits of using Rails:
The installation process will depend on your operating system. You will go through installing Ruby on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Step 1) Download Rubyinstaller
The easiest way to install Ruby on your Windows computer is through Ruby Installer which you can download at https://rubyinstaller.org/.
All you have to do is run the downloaded installer.
Step 2) Click on downloaded installer
Double-click on downloaded installer ‘rubyinstaller-2.4.1-2-x64.exe’.
Step 3) Accept the license
Select the ‘I accept the license’ radio button and click the ‘Next’ button. This should bring you to the next Figure below:
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="584" height="482" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails1.png" alt="Download and Install Ruby on Windows">
Step 4) Check first two checkboxes
Check the first two checkboxes to make running Ruby scripts easier.
Click the ‘Install’ button to get the Installation started. You should see the Figure below when the Installation completes.
<img decoding="async" width="555" height="438" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails2.png" alt="Download and Install Ruby on Windows">
Step 5) Click on Finish
Do not uncheck the checkbox option that installs MSYS2. Click “Finish” to complete the Installation and a command prompt window shown in the Figure below will be displayed.
<img decoding="async" width="507" height="396" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails3.png" alt="Download and Install Ruby on Windows">
Step 6) Installs MSYS2
This step installs MSYS2, a building platform that features a package manager for easy Installation of packages on Windows.
Press Enter to install all the components as they are all required to have a smooth Ruby on Rails development environment to work with on Windows.
<img decoding="async" width="667" height="328" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails4.png" alt="Download and Install Ruby on Windows">
You should have Ruby installed from the previous section, and now you are going to install Rails. You can install Rails using a package from RailsInstaller, but the problem with this is that you don’t get the latest version of the required packages.
If you have already have the latest Ruby and a baseline set of required RubyGems and extensions installed. All you need do now is run the following command at the command prompt to get Rails on your system: ‘gem install rails.’
You will also need to install Node.js if you don’t already have it because some libraries that Rails depends on require a Javascript runtime to work correctly. You can get node at https://nodejs.org.
It is a more common and preferred approach to developing on Windows. Rails community uses a Windows Subsystem for Linux that provides a GNU/Linux environment with command-line tools, utilities, and common applications directly on Windows.
Your Mac already has Ruby pre-installed on it. However, the pre-installed version might be old, and so you will need to install a new/latest version.
The easiest way to do this is by using a package manager such as Homebrew. You might first need to install Homebrew by running the command below at the Terminal.
This will display a warning and ask you to enter your password. Enter your Mac password (you won’t see the characters as you type). Just press ‘Enter’ when you are done typing your password. Then run this simple Homebrew command to install Ruby on your Mac.
And also run this command:
To set this Ruby installation as the default Ruby to run on your system and not the pre-installed Ruby.
To confirm the Installation was successful, you can run the following at the Terminal
this will print the Ruby version number you have installed. The output will look something like
The easiest way to get Ruby installed on your Ubuntu system is through the apt package manager. You need to run the following commands at the Terminal to install the latest Ruby from Ubuntu repositories.
To confirm the Installation was successful, you can run the following ‘ruby –version,’ this will print the Ruby version you have installed. 
You should follow the steps below to successfully install Rails on your Linux machine.
Step 1) Update your computer gem manager by running ‘gem update –system’ at the Terminal or command prompt.
Step 2) Run ‘gem install rails’ to install the latest version of Rails on your computer.
Step 3) You should install bundler gem for easy Rails application gem dependency management. Run ‘gem install bundler’ to get it.
Rails follow basic software design principles and encourage you to use those principles too.
The two most common are:
With Rails now installed on your system lets create a Rails application! We will learn Ruby on Rails examples and how to create a Todo list application in this Ruby on Rails tutorial. Run the following command ‘rails new todo_app’ in your Terminal to create the application.
This command creates a directory named ‘todo_app’ in the current directory with the basic folder structure of a Rails web application, as shown in the Figure below:
<img decoding="async" width="542" height="700" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails5.png" alt="Rails – Project File Structures">
You will go through the main directories in this Ruby on Rails example.
app – This directory groups using different subdirectories for the UI/layout (views and helpers), the controller (controllers files) and the models (business/application logic).
app/controllers – This directory stores controller files used by Rails to handle requests from the client.
app/assets – It contains static files, which is a need for the application’s front-end grouped into folders based on their type – JavaScript files, images, and stylesheets.
app/helpers – This subdirectory contains helper functions that make your application model, view, and controller logic focused, small and uncluttered.
app/models – This contains files
that model your application’s database. The model classes make working with the database very easy.
app/views – This hold template/layout files the user of your application interacts with. The templates are a combination of HTML and data from the database.
bin – It contains Rails scripts that starts your application. It can also include other scripts that you use to set up and upgrade the application.
Config – This holds configuration files – database.yml, environment.rb, routes.rb, etc. that your application needs to run.
DB – This directory contains files/scripts that are used to manage your application database.
lib – This directory contains an extended module for your application.
log – This contains log files – server.log, development.log, test.log, and production.log, etc., that are used for debugging or monitoring your application.
public – This directory contains static files and compiled assets, such as HTML files, Javascript files, images, and stylesheets.
test – This directory holds test files you write to test your application functionality.
tmp – This directory contains temporary files like cache and pid files.
vendor – This directory contains third-party libraries.
Gemfile – This file specifies what your basic gem requirements are to run your web application. You can group the gems into development, test or production and Rails will know when to include each gem.
Gemfile.lock – Unlike the Gemfile that explicitly lists the gems you want in your application, Gemfile.lock additionally contains other gems that those you list in the Gemfile depends on that are then automatically installed to satisfy the dependencies.
Readme.md – You use this file to share essential detail about your application, such as what the app does, how to go about installing and run the application.
Rakefile – This file contains various rake tasks definitions, which helps in automating everyday administration tasks of your application.
config.ru – This is a Rack configuration file that provides an interface to the webserver to start your application.
Change directory to the ‘todo_app’ directory Rails generated and run ‘rails server’ to start the application. Type localhost:3000 in the address bar of your web browser, you should see the Figure below if all went well.
<img decoding="async" width="900" height="592" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails6.png" alt="Rails – Project File Structures">
This is the default homepage of your application, and you will change this in the later section of this Ruby on Rails tutorial. You can stop the server by pressing ‘Ctrl-C’.
The Rails generate command makes use of templates to create a whole lot of useful things in your application. You can use these generators to save a lot of time.
It helps by writing boilerplate code, code that is necessary for your web application to work. You can run ‘rails generate’ by itself at the command prompt or Terminal to see a list of available generators as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="658" height="900" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails7.png" alt="Rails – Generate commands">
You can also run ‘rails generate “command”‘ to see a description of what the command does. It offers convenient options that can be run with the command and usage example. The Figure below shows the output of running‘ rails generate controller’:
<img decoding="async" width="839" height="900" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails8.png" alt="Rails – Generate commands">
You will use the rails generate scaffold command to automatically create the model, view, and controller for the todo list application you are building. Run‘ rails generate scaffold todo_list title:string description: text’ in your Terminal (check you are still in the todo_app directory).
This will create a full CRUD (Create, read, update, and delete) web interface for the TodoLists table.
Another useful command to know is ‘rails destroy,’ it reverses whatever ‘rails generate…’ does.


The Rails routing system, rails router, handles all incoming requests to your web application. It does this by examining the URL of the incoming requests and then maps each request to the controller action responsible for handling it, using special syntax specified in the routes file (config/routes.rb).
The routes file helps in controlling every URL aspect of your web application. Rails by default use a RESTful design based on the REST architectural style, that provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and requests (URLs) to controller actions.
The routes file was generated when you ran ‘rails new’ in an earlier section of this tutorial. Continuing with the Todo application that you are building, run the following‘ rails db:migrate’ (you will get to know what this does shortly)
In your command line, make sure you are still at the root of the application (the todo_app directory).
Then start the server again with ‘rails server’. Type http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/ in your browser and press Enter. You should get back a webpage as shown in the below figure of Ruby on Rails example:
<img decoding="async" width="898" height="560" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails9.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
This is the Todo lists view that the scaffold command generated and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s index action.
Go ahead and add a todo list by clicking on the ‘New Todo List’ on the page, you should get the page as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="840" height="424" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails10.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
Notice the URL is changed to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/new. This is the page to create a new todo list, and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s new method/action.
Enter your todo list title and description in the form and click the Create Todo list button, the URL should change to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/1, shown in the below figure of Ruby on Rails code example:
<img decoding="async" width="866" height="559" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails11.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
This is the show page of a todo list, and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s show method/action. If you go back to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/, you should now see the Figure below with a new todo list added:
<img decoding="async" width="966" height="597" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails12.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
Rails was able to map the various requests (URLs) to the corresponding TodoListsController’s action using the route definition in config/routes.rb.
If you take a peek at this file, you see a single line ‘resources: todo_lists’, is Rails default way of writing restful routes. This single line creates seven routes all mapping to the TodoLists controller.
By convention, each controller’s action also maps to a specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operation in the database.
You can run ‘rake routes’ in your command line to see the various routes available in your application. The Figure below shows the output of running ‘rails routes’ in your command line/terminal.
<img decoding="async" width="980" height="214" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails13.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
The View layer is one of the components of the MVC paradigm and is responsible for generating HTML response for each request to your application. Rails by default use ERB (Embedded Ruby) which is a powerful templating system for Ruby.
ERB makes writing templates easy and maintainable by combining plain text with Ruby code for variable substitution and flow control. An ERB template has .html, .erb or .erb extension.
You will mostly use a combination of two tag markers only, each of which causes the embedded code to be processed and handled in a particular way.
A tag with an equal’s sign ‘<%= %>’ indicates that embedded code is an expression and that the result of the code should be substituted by the renderer when it renders the template.
The other tag with no equals sign ‘<% %>’ indicates to the renderer that the result of the code should not be substituted/printed when it renders the template.
Each controller in your Rails application has a corresponding subdirectory in app/views, and each action/method in a controller has a corresponding .html and .erb file in this directory.
Take a look at app/views of the todo app you are building. You will find a subdirectory named ‘todo_lists’ inside this subdirectory .html.erb files with names corresponding to the actions/methods in the TodoLists controller.
ActiveRecord is the Ruby implementation of the Active Record pattern, which is a simple pattern where a class represents a table, and an instance of the class represents a row in that class.
ActiveRecord is popularly referred to as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping), a technique that allows you to manage your database using a language you’re most comfortable with. It is database agnostic thus you can easily switch between databases (for example SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.). This suite more for your application requirement with the same code/logic.
So, if you want to get an array containing a listing of all the todo lists in your application, so,  instead of writing code to initiate a connection to the database, then doing some sort of SQL SELECT query, and converting those results into an array. 
For that, you just need to type ‘TodoList.all’ and Active Record gives you the array filled with TodoList objects that you can play with as you like.
All you need do is set up the right configuration in config/database.yml, and Active Record will work out all the differences between the various database system. So when you switch from one to the other, you don’t have to think about it.
You focus on writing code for your application, and Active Record will think about the low-level details of connecting you to your database. Active Record makes use of naming conventions to create the mapping between models and database tables.
Rails pluralize your model class names to find the corresponding database table. So, for a class TodoList, ActiveRecord will create a database table called TodoLists.
Rails migration is simply a script that you use to edit your application database. It is used to set up or change your database and avoids manually writing SQL code to do that.
It uses Ruby to define changes to database schema and makes it possible to use version control to keep your database synchronized.
Rails Migrations use a Ruby Domain Specific Language (DSL). This acts as an abstraction and makes it possible to use or change your database engine based on your requirements.
They can be shared with anyone working on the application and can also be rolled back to undo any changes to the database. This is a high safety mechanism as you don’t have to bother about doing permanent damage to your database.
A connection between two ActiveRecord models is known as an association. Association makes it much easier to perform operations on the different records in your code. It can be divided into four categories: –
One to One: – This indicates that a record contains precisely one instance of another model. A good example is user profile. A user has only one profile. It uses has _one keyword.
One to Many: – This is the most common association, and it indicates that one model has zero or more instances of another model. Your use has a _many keyword to denote this association.
Many to Many: – This association is a bit more complicated, and ActiveRecord provides two ways to handle it. Using the has_and_belongs_to_many and has_many, which gives you access to the relation that is defined in a separate table.
Polymorphic One to Many:- This is a more advanced association available to you in Rails. You can use it to define a model that may belong to many different models on a single association.
Validation helps to ensure that you have correct data because working with wrong data is an awful thing and could cost you your money and business.
Validation also provides an extra layer of security for your application against malicious users from gaining access to information in your database. Rails offer you a nice API of validation helpers in ActiveRecord to keep your database clean, secure, and free of errors.
ActiveRecord validations run on model objects before saving to the database, making them more reliable and also best practice to follow in building your application.
The following ActiveRecord methods evoke validations when used or called on model objects – create, create!, save, save!, update, and update!. The ones with a bang (create!, save! and update!) raise an exception if a record is invalid while thothen’t’tt’t’t.
The most common ActiveRecord validation helpers at your disposal are:-
Confirmation:– This validation helper is useful for validating two fields have the same entry. e.g., password and password confirmation, it is used in conjunction with the presence validation helper.
Presence:– This checks that the field is not empty.
uniqueness: ensures unique value for a field, e.g., username
Length:- To enforce a limit on character length of a field
You can also create your custom validation by using the validate method and passing it the name of the custom validation method.
You can check the model’s error object to find out why a validation. Hopefully, you have some ideas to make your application more constrained and more secured to only allow secure data into your database.
The Rails controller is the center of your web application. It facilitates and coordinates the communication between the user, the models, and the views.
Your controller classes inherit from the ApplicationController, that contains code that can be run in all other controllers and it inherits from ActionController class.
The controller provides the following to your application: 
You can configure the various components such as initializers, assets, generators, middlewares, etc.  By using your Rails application initializers and configuration files in the config directory. Files like config/application.rb, config/environments/development.rb  and  config/environments/test.rb etc. You can also have custom settings configure for your application.
As you build out your application, there will come a time you will need/have to debug your code. Rails make this easy using the byebug gem. You can start a debugging session by putting the ‘byebeg’ keyword anywhere in your application code.
This will temporarily stop execution at that point. The byebug gem gives you several commands to use. The most useful ones are:
There are other debugging gems available such as ‘pry’, and they all provide similar functionalities but slightly different syntax. Debugging gems should not be used in production as this pose’s risks to your application and bad experience to your application users.
There are log files that you can inspect for errors in production and handle them. Also, you should follow a TDD (Test-driven development) approach when developing your application to ensure everything works well before deploying to production.

WPF is a framework for building Windows applications that allow users to develop rich user interfaces having 3D animations and rich colors with less code complexity. It is a vector-based rendering engine that uses hardware acceleration of modern graphics cards, which makes the Ul faster and highly scalable. WPF stands for Windows Presentation Foundation.

WPF can be considered as an evolution over WinForms. It produces easy to operate graphical display system for Windows. It offers easy separation between UI and business logic.
WPF applications can be deployed in your system as a standalone desktop program or hosted as an embedded object in a website.
There are many reasons for using WPF platform some prominent ones are-
Windows 1.0 was the first GUI environment from Microsoft. It is working as a layer on top of DOS, relying on the GDI and USER systems for graphic and user interface.
DirectX was introduced in the year 1995, as a high-performance graphics system. It was aimed at games and other graphics related environments. Over the years there are many versions released with Directx9 that provides a library to use with mange.Net code.
The latest stable version of WPF 5.0.6 which is released in April 2021.
Next in this WPF C# tutorial, we will learn about WPF core types and Infrastructure.
Classes in WPF are divided into four different types:
These classes, known as base element classes. It provides the foundation for a model of composing user interfaces.
WPF user interfaces are composed of elements which are assembled in a tree hierarchy. It is called the element tree. The element tree is an intuitive way to layout user interface. It is a structure which allows you to get the feature of powerful UI services.
Extensible Application Markup Language which is called “XAML”, or “zammel” is a declarative way to define user interfaces.
Here is the XAML definition of a simple button:
Advantage of using XAML language:
WPF framework supports many useful controls like:
The appearance of controls can be customized with styles and templates without programming. You can also create a custom control by deriving a new class from an appropriate base class.
WPF provides a feature for customizing the appearance of your application. It allows you to set objects and values for things like fonts, backgrounds, etc.
The styles feature allows you to standardize on a specific look for the entire product. It allows you to replace the default appearance while retaining its default behavior.
Data template allows you to control the default visualization of the bound data.  With the help of themes, you can easily visualize styles from the operating system.
Layout helps you in proper positioning and sizing control. It is part of the process of composing the presentation for the user. The WPF framework eases the layout process and offers better adaptability of the UI appearance.
The layout infrastructure is offered by various classes are 1) StackPanel 2)DockPanel 3) WrapPanel 4) Grid and 5) Canvas
WPF provides an improved graphics system like
WPF framework offers three types of documents:
WPF enables better control over the print system. It includes remote printing and queues. Moreover, XPS documents can be printed directly without converting it into a print format.
WPF is a part of the .NET framework. It contains both managed and unmanaged code. The important components of WPF architecture are explained in the below-given figure:
Refer to this link to install WPF https://www.guru99.com/download-install-visual-studio.html
Next in this WPF application tutorial, we will build our first WPF.

This scala tutorial covers all the aspects and topics of scala. You will learn all the fundamentals from scratch like What is scala, the Installation process of scala, Scala programs, Scala Functions, Lazy evaluation, Type interface, classes and objects, Inheritance, Abstractions, Java and scala differences, etc.
Scala is a statically typed programming language that incorporates both functional and object-oriented programming to increase scalability of applications. Scala primarily runs on JVM platform and it can also be used to write software for native platforms using Scala-Native and JavaScript runtimes through ScalaJs.
Scala is a Scalable Language used to write Software for multiple platforms. Hence, it got the name “Scala”. This language is intended to solve the problems of Java while simultaneously being more concise. Initially designed by Martin Odersky, it was released in 2003.
Here are the prime reasons for learning Scala Programming Language:
To begin writing Scala programs, you need to have it installed on your computer. In order to do this, you will need to visit their site https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ in order to download the latest version of Scala.
Following the link, we’re led to two options which we can choose to install Scala on our machines. For this Scala tutorial, we’ll download the IntelliJ IDEA.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="739" height="414" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori1.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Once you visit the download link, you’ll find two versions of the IntelliJ IDE.
For this Scala tutorial, we’ll download the Community Edition, which is free and comes with all you need to write Scala programs.
<img decoding="async" width="618" height="314" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori2.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 1)  Select Community Edition
On the page, click on the dropdown on the Community Edition.
It presents us with an option to download the IntelliJ IDE together with JBR which contains a JDK  implementation(Java Development Kit)  OpenJDK which Scala needs to compile and run the code.
<img decoding="async" width="441" height="448" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori3.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 2) Run the installation
Once you download IntelliJ, double click it in order to run the installation wizard and follow the dialog.
<img decoding="async" width="498" height="383" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori4.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 3) Select a location
Choose a location to install the IDE.
<img decoding="async" width="487" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori5.png" alt="How to install Scala">
If by chance you didn’t download the one with the JDK, we still get a prompt where that we can check to download it by selecting the checkbox.
<img decoding="async" width="497" height="379" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori6.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 4) Click on next
Leave the other defaults as they are and click next.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori7.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 5) Click on startup icon
Once the installation completes, run the IntelliJ IDE by clicking its startup icon in the startup menu like a regular application.
<img decoding="async" width="774" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori8.png" alt="How to install Scala">
You still need to go through an additional step of adding the Scala plugin to IntelliJ; you do so by clicking the dropdown on the configure menu located at the bottom right of the screen and selecting the plugin option.
<img decoding="async" width="593" height="617" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori9.png" alt="How to install Scala">
<img decoding="async" width="798" height="657" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori10.png" alt="How to install Scala">
On the Marketplace tab, a search for Scala will present the plugin as the first result under the Languages tag.
Step 6) Install Plugin
Click install, which will lead the plugin beginning the download.
<img decoding="async" width="317" height="305" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori11.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 7) Restart the IDE
After the download completes, you’ll be prompted to restart the IDE so that the installed plugin can start working.
<img decoding="async" width="253" height="321" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori12.png" alt="How to install Scala">
After restarting you’ll find yourself on the same page as before when we ran the IDE, but this time around we have already installed the Scala plugin.
Step 1) Select the Create Project option, which will lead us to a page where we can select the kind of language our project will be using.
<img decoding="async" width="774" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori13.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Step 2) choose Scala by selecting the Scala checkbox and click next.
<img decoding="async" width="685" height="713" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori14.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Step 3) Select a location to save our projects file and give our project a name.
<img decoding="async" width="701" height="106" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori15.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
If the directory doesn’t exist, IntelliJ will prompt us to ask us for permission to create the folder. Accept and click finish. You will be taken to your Scala project, which currently doesn’t have any Scala code.
It will take some time to load some indexes so don’t worry if you’re not able to immediately do anything while there’s a progress bar at the bottom of your IDE, it simply means your IDE is loading some files necessary to run Scala and help with IDE autocompletion.
Step 4) Next, we’ll click on the projects tab on the left of the IDE and expand so we can see the contents of our project.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="281" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori16.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
At the moment the project is empty and only contains a .idea folder and hello-world.iml file generated by the IDE.  Our point of interest is the src folder.  Src is where we store the source code for our project. It’s where we’ll create our first Scala file.
Step 5) Right-click on src to open a menu to create a new Scala file.
<img decoding="async" width="667" height="322" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori17.png" alt="Create a new Scala file">
We will then create a name for the file, in this Scala tutorial we’ll use hello and then choose from a dropdown what to put as the content of the Scala file. Select “Object”
<img decoding="async" width="436" height="294" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori18.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Once we do this, we’ll have a Scala file that has a Singleton object that we’ll use to run our code.
<img decoding="async" width="456" height="256" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori19.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Now that you have a Scala file with a Hello object.  You will write your first program by extending the object you have created using the App keyword.
Extending our object with App tell the compiler which code to run when it starts your program. Immediately after extending App, a green arrow shows up on the left side, indicating that you can now be able to run your program.
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="109" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori20.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
<img decoding="async" width="298" height="123" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori21.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Inside the Hello object, we write one function println() which is used to print the text inside it to the console. We will run our code by clicking on the green arrow.
Clicking the arrow presents us with the option Run, hello, upon clicking it, our code will start compiling and after some seconds we’ll see the results of our program printed from the console that’s inbuilt in the IntelliJ IDE.
<img decoding="async" width="488" height="515" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori22.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
And there we go, we have successfully installed Scala and run our first program.
The Scala language has anonymous functions, which are also called function literals. Scala being a functional language often means developers break down large problems into many small tasks and create many functions to solve these problems. To make it easy to create functions, Scala contains these functions that can be instantiated without a name. We can assign them directly to variables or definitions ‘def’ as shown in the below Scala example:
We can then use the normal way we use functions by passing parameters to them follows.
These methods come in handy when we want to have a clean and concise code. We can use anonymous functions when defining methods that are not large and don’t require a lot of code in their body. They’re very simple and don’t need a ceremony to create.
These methods are not limited to functions with arguments and can be used to instantiate methods that don’t take in any arguments.
Most of these anonymous functions are used in other parts of our code where we need to create a quick function in place.
Another reason why these functions are also referred to as inline functions. Using anonymous functions is a common pattern which is used pervasively in the collections library to perform quick actions over a collection.
For instance, we have the filter method that takes an inline function/anonymous function to create another collection with only elements that meet the criteria we define in the anonymous function.
Here the methods we have as anonymous functions are the ones checking if the value we’re getting from the list is odd and even and returning the item.
In Scala, it’s also possible to use wildcards where our anonymous function’s parameter aren’t named. For example
In this scenario, we don’t name the parameter we’re passing in. The only thing we use an underscore to represent it.


Most languages sequentially evaluate variables and function parameters, one after the other. In Scala, we have a keyword called lazy, which helps in dealing with values we don’t want to be evaluated until they’re referenced.
A variable marked as lazy won’t be evaluated where it is defined, that’s commonly known as eager evaluation, it will only be evaluated when it’s referenced at some later in the code.
This can be helpful when evaluating a value might be an expensive computation, if it’s not the case that the value is always needed, we can save ourselves from running an expensive computation which can slow down our software by making our variable lazy.
This is not the only use case for lazy variables. They also help deal with issues of circular dependency in code.
In case the settings is false, we might not need to use myExpensiveValue, which can lead us to save us from doing an expensive computation which helps ensure that users have a nice time using our application as our their other needs can be properly computed without overwhelming the RAM.
In case the settings is false, we might not need to use myExpensiveValue, which can lead us to save us from doing an expensive computation which helps ensure that users have a nice time using our application as our their other needs can be computed appropriately without overwhelming the RAM.
The laziness also helps with function arguments, where the arguments are only used when they’re referenced inside the function. This concept is called Call-by-name parameters.
Many languages use the call-by-value way of evaluating arguments. The parameter passed through call-by-name will only be evaluated when needed in the function body and will not be evaluated before that. Once the value is evaluated, it is stored and can be reused later without it having to be re-evaluated. A concept which is known as memoization.
In Scala, you don’t have to declare types for every variable you create. This is because the Scala compiler can do type inference on types based on evaluation of the right-hand side. This allows your code to be more concise – it frees us from writing boilerplate where the expected type is obvious
A higher-order function is a function that can take functions as arguments and can return a function as a return type. In Scala, functions are considered first-class citizens. Using these functions this way enables us to be very flexible in the kind of programs we can make. We can create functions dynamically and feed in functionality dynamically to other functions.
In the above function, we pass in an int and a function that takes an int and returns an int. We can pass in any function of that signature. By signature, we mean a function’s input and output. A signature of Int=>Int means that a function takes an Int as input and returns an Int as its output.
A Signature of ()=>Int means that a function takes nothing as it’s input and returns an Int as its output. An example of a function like that would be one that generates a random int for us.
The above function has a signature ()=>Int
We can have a function that has a signature scala   ()=>Unit. This means the functions don’t take anything in and doesn’t return a type. The function could be doing some kind of computation by changing something to doing something predetermined.
These kinds of methods are not encouraged, though, as they seem to be a black box that can affect a system in some unknown ways. They’re also untestable. Having explicit input and output types enable us to reason about what our function does.
A higher-order function can also return a function.
For example, we could create a method that will create a powering function, i.e., takes a number and applies power to it.
The above function takes an int. Our return type is an anonymous function that takes an Int x, * we use the int x as the argument for the power function.
In Scala, we can convert a function that takes two arguments into one that takes one argument at a time. When we pass in one argument, we partially apply it and end up with a function that takes one argument to complete the function. Currying enables us to create functions by partially adding some arguments.
This can be useful for creating functions dynamically before we have a complete set of arguments
If we need to create a function that multiplies by some specific number, we don’t need to create another multiplication method.
We can simply call the .curried on our function above and get a function that takes one argument first and return a partially applied function
Scala has a powerful inbuilt mechanism for helping us check a whether a variable matches up to certain criteria, much like we would do in a switch statement in Java or in a series of if/else statements. The language has pattern matching that we can use to check whether a variable is of a particular type. Pattern matching in Scala is powerful and can be used destructure the components that have an unapply method in order to get fields we’re interested in directly from the variable we’re matching.
Scala’s pattern matching also provides a more pleasant syntax compared to switch statement.
We compare our variable to a set of options, and when the variable we’re matching up meets the criteria, the expression on the right-hand side of the fat arrow (=>) evaluates and is returned as the result of the match.
We use an underscore to catch cases that are unmatched in our code. It mirrors the behavior of the default case when dealing with switch statements.
In the code above, you are able to find out the type of the myItem variable and based on that branch off to some specific code.
Pattern matching checks whether the variable matches
The underscore works as a placeholder that matches any other condition that is not matched by the other items in the case statements above.  We take a variable myItem and call the match method.
With Case classes, we can even go further and destructure the class to get fields inside the object.
By using the sealed keyword to define our classes, we get the benefit of having the compiler exhaustively check the cases we try to match against and warn us if we forget to handle a particular one.
It’s possible to create values that can’t be changed by other functions in Scala using the val keyword. This is achieved in Java by using the final keyword. In Scala, we do so by using a val keyword when creating a variable instead of using var, which is the alternative we would use to create a mutable variable.
A variable defined using the val keyword is read-only, whereas one defined with var can be read and be changed by other functions or arbitrarily by the user in the code.
Trying to assign a value to myNumber after we’ve declared it as a val throws a compile-time error or “reassignment to val.”
Immutability helps us prevent code and other programmers from changing our values unexpectedly, which would lead to unexpected results if they are intended to use the value we store they can instead make a copy of it. This way, bugs that can be caused by multiple actors changing the same variable are prevented.
We all know that objects are the real-world entities, and class is a template that defines objects. Classes have both state and behaviors. The states are either values or variables.  The behaviors are the methods in Scala.
Let us look into how you can define a class, instantiate it, and use it using Scala.
Here, the class called Rectangle, which has two variables and two functions. You can also use the parameters l and b directly as fields in the program. You have an object which has a main method and has instantiated the class with two values.
Example:
All the fields and method are by default public in Scala. It is essential to use override because toString method is defined for Object in Scala.
Scala has multiple types of inheritance (like single, multi-level, multiple, hierarchical, hybrid,) that share a lot in common with traditional forms found in Java. You can inherit both from classes and traits. You can inherit the members of one class into another class using the keyword “extends”. This enables reusability.
It’s possible to inherit from one class or multiple classes. It’s also possible to inherit from subclasses that themselves have their superclasses, creating a hierarchy of inheritance in the process.
In the below Scala example, the Base class is Circle, and derived class is Sphere. A circle has a value called radius, which is inherited in the Sphere class. The method calcArea is overridden using the keyword override.
Example:
In Scala, we can create abstract methods and member fields using abstract classes and traits.  Inside abstract classes and traits, we can define abstract fields without necessarily implementing them.
Example:
These fields are implemented by the classes that extend the trait or abstract class. You can use traits to create contracts as to what our application should be able to do and then implement those methods later.
This way, we can plan out how our application will look like without implementing the methods which can help us envision how various methods will look like. It follows along a pattern know as programming to abstractions and not the actual implementation.
The class which is prefaced with keyword abstract can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. But, multiple inheritances is not supported in abstract class. So, you can extend at most one abstract class.
A Singleton is a class that is only instantiated once in a program. It’s from a popular and useful programming pattern known as the “singleton pattern”. It’s useful in creating instances that are meant to be long-living and will be commonly accessed throughout your program whose state is integral in coordinating the events of a system. Creating such a class in Scala is easy as Scala provides us with a simple means of creating singletons using the object keyword.
We can then reference this object throughout our program with the guarantee that all parts of our program will see the same data as there’s only one instance of it.
The concept of static members is not there in Scala, that is the reason you need to use singleton objects, which act like static members of a class.
Implicit classes are the new functionality added after version 2.1. It is primarily to add new functionality to the closed classes.
The implicit keyword should be defined in a class, object, or trait. The primary constructor of an implicit class should have exactly one argument in its first parameter list. It may also include an additional implicit parameter list.
In the below Scala example, new functionality to replace vowels of a String with * is added.
You need to import in the class where you are  using it.
In OOP programs are constructed by grouping data and the functions that operate on that data into highly connected units. Objects carry their data in the fields and methods that operate on them.  In this style of programming, the main abstraction is the data as the methods that are created are meant to operate on the data.
Functional programming, on the other hand, separates data and the functions that operate on the data. This enables developers to treats functions as the abstraction and driving force when modeling programs.
Scala enables functional programming by having functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as values to other functions and returned as values as well. The combination of these two paradigms has made Scala a great choice in building complex software in various industries, such as Data Science.
Here, are some important frameworks of Scala
Scala has some of the best concurrency libraries in the Java ecosystem.
Here are the main difference between Java and Scala.
In this tutorial, you have learned how to get started with Scala. You have also learned the functional and object-oriented features. You have also discovered the similarities and differences between Java and Scala. This tutorial should have helped you with a wide variety of examples that are well demonstrated.

The modern web application has really come a long way over the years with the introduction of many popular frameworks such as bootstrap, Angular JS, etc. All of these frameworks are based on the popular JavaScript framework.
But when it came to developing server-based applications, there was a kind of void, and this is where Node.js came into the picture.
Node.js is also based on the JavaScript framework, but it is used for developing server-based applications. While going through the entire tutorial, we will look into Node.js in detail and how we can use it to develop server-based applications.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment used for the development of server-side web applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run on a wide variety of operating systems.
Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking Input/Output API that is designed to optimize an application’s throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.
Over a long period of time, the framework available for web development were all based on a stateless model. A stateless model is where the data generated in one session (such as information about user settings and events that occurred) is not maintained for usage in the next session with that user.
A lot of work had to be done to maintain the session information between requests for a user. But with Node.js, there is finally a way for web applications to have real-time two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely.
We will have a look into the real worth of Node.js in the coming chapters, but what is it that makes this framework so famous. Over the years, most of the applications were based on a stateless request-response framework. In these sort of applications, it is up to the developer to ensure the right code was put in place to ensure the state of web session was maintained while the user was working with the system.
But with Node.js web applications, you can now work in real-time and have a 2-way communication. The state is maintained, and either the client or server can start the communication.
Let’s look at some of the key features of Node.js
Node.js is used by many large companies. Below is a list of a few of them.
Node.js is best for usage in streaming or event-based real-time applications like
Node.js is good when you need high levels of concurrency but less amount of dedicated CPU time.
Best of all, since Node.js is built on javascript, it’s best suited when you build client-side applications which are based on the same javascript framework.
Node.js can be used for a lot of applications with various purposes. The only scenario where it should not be used is where there are long processing times, which is required by the application.
Node is structured to be single-threaded. If an application is required to carry out some long-running calculations in the background, it won’t be able to process any other requests. As discussed above, Node.js is used best where processing needs less dedicated CPU time.

The course is designed for SQL beginners. No prior DB experience is required.
MariaDB
A database management system (DBMS) is a software used to store and manage data. It guarantees the quality, durability, and confidentiality of information. The most popular type of DBMS are  Relational Database Management Systems, or RDBMSs. Here,  the database consists of a structured set of tables and each row of a table is a record.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a DBMS. In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS. Following are types of SQL Statements
A Query is a set of instruction given to the database management system. It tells any database what information you would like to get from the database. For example, to fetch the student name from the database table STUDENT, you can write the SQL Query like this:
When you want to execute an SQL command for any DBMS system, you need to find the best method to carry out your request, and SQL engine determines how to interpret that specific task.
Important  components included in this SQL process are:
A classic query engine allows you to manage all the non-SQL queries.

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Perl is a term stands for “Practical Extraction and Reporting Language” even though there is no acronym for Perl. It was introduced by Larry Wall in 1987. Perl language was specially designed for text editing. But now, it is widely used for a variety of purposes including Linux system administration, network programming, web development, etc.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="576" height="345" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1135_Introductio4.png" alt="Programming Languages Overview" border="0">		
Let’s put it in a simple manner. While computers understand just 0’s and 1’s (binary language/machine language/ [low-level language]), it is very difficult to program in a binary language for us human. Perl is a programming language which uses natural language elements, words that are used in common English language and is, therefore, easier to understand by humans [high-level language]. Now there’s a problem; computers cannot understand high-level languages, which we humans can easily understand. For that, we need something which can translate the high-level language to low-level language. Here interpreter comes to our help. The interpreter is a piece of software which converts the program written in the high-level language to low-level language for the computer to understand and execute the instructions written in the program. Hence, Perl is an interpreted programming language.
The power of Perl scripting language can be implemented in many fields. The most popular use of Perl is in Web development., Perl is also used to automate many tasks in the Web servers, and other administration jobs, it can automatically generate emails and clean up systems. Perl is still used for its original purpose i.e. extracting data and generating reports. It can produce reports on resource use and check for security issues in a network. Due to this reason, Perl has become a popular language used in web development, networking and bioinformatics too. Apart from all this perl can also be used for CGI programming.
Perl can also be utilized for image creation & manipulation. Apart from that networking via telnet, FTP, etc., Graphical User Interface creation, VLSI electronics & to create mail filters to reduce spamming practices are some use cases of Perl.
Perl is also known for implementation of OOP(object oriented programming) practices and supports all forms of inheritance (simple, multiple & diamond), polymorphism and encapsulation. Perl is flexible enough to support Procedural as well as OOP practices simultaneously. Perl also has extra modules which permit you to write or use/reuse code written in Python, PHP, PDL, TCL, Octave, Java, C, C++, Basic, Ruby and Lua in your Perl script. This means that you can combine Perl with these extra programming languages rather rewriting existing code.



Applications of Perl Programming Language


It is true that there are other programming languages that can be used to do all the stuff that has been stated above, then why should you specifically use Perl? Perl is very easy to learn, especially if you have a background in computer programming. Perl was designed to be easy for humans to write and understand rather than making it easy for processing by computers. It uses regular expressions. It’s natural style of language is different from other programming languages that use specific grammar and syntaxes; therefore, Perl is very flexible and doesn’t impose on you any particular way of thinking out a solution or a problem. Perl is extremely portable. It can run on any operating system that has Perl interpreter installed, so it is platform independent. All Linux Operating Systems come installed with Perl, so you can start Perl coding in Linux out of the box. This is unlike Shell scripts, where the code changes with the flavor of Linux distribution being used, making it less and less portable Small specific tasks in Perl become very easy and quick. Throughout this Perl tutorial for beginners, you will learn how you can code small, quick programs for specific tasks. Let’s take a simple example of the classic Hello World program which is used to begin learning any programming language which has UNIX as its roots: 
<img decoding="async" width="364" height="386" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1135_Introductio6.png" alt="Simple Example of Perl" border="0">		
Output:
Hello, world!
The above two lines of code will print Hello, world! Now wasn’t it too simple and quick? Students with knowledge of C, C++ will know that it requires many more lines of code to obtain the same output in those languages.  
You might be wondering why Perl is so famous on the Web. It is simple as most of the things that happen on the web are of TEXT and Perl is very good at text processing. If we compare Perl with any of the languages, then Perl will be the best language which is good in File handling, text processing, and output reporting
One of the best advantages of Perl is that it is free to use		
The Perl community strongly believes that software should be freely available, freely modifiable and freely distributable. Several volunteers from Perl community strive to make the programming language as good as possible.

With enough knowledge about the history of Perl and basic concepts of computer programming required for coding in Perl, it is time we take the dive and get started with Perl. The next chapter will teach you how you can setup Perl on your system and get ready for the coding journey in Perl. This Perl scripting tutorial will take Linux as the OS which students will be using for coding in Perl.
Good news you probably have it!		
But if you can’t find it already on your system, you can still get it for free.
To find out if you already have Perl installed, go into the command line and type: perl -v

The command will display version of Perl if it’s installed. In this case, the version is v5.14.2. But if not… don’t panic…

If you need to update the Perl version then just enter one single line of command
sudo apt-get install perl		
and relax. The rest will be taken care of. Just make sure you have an active internet connection.

First, download the Active Perl from this link. Follow these steps to install ActivePerl on Windows system. See the below screenshots for the same.
Step 1: Once you download the installer and start the installation you will see the below window, click on next to proceed.
<img decoding="async" width="505" height="386" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1141_SettingUpan10.png" alt="How to install Perl on Windows" border="0">		
Step 2: Accept Licensing agreement to proceed the installation.

Step 3: Below are different packages that will be installed. By default, all will be selected. The only thing different is PPM (Perl Package Manager). This is the utility provided by Active Perl to install external Perl modules or libraries in your system. Click on Next to proceed.
<img decoding="async" width="505" height="398" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1141_SettingUpan12.png" alt="Installing Perl on Windows" border="0">		
Step 4: These are different types of Perl extensions that can be used for Perl. Mostly we will be using .Pl, .Plx and .Pm for Perl. Perl modules basically use .Pm as their file extension to refer to a library file. Select all the options and click on the Next button.

There are lots of things which needs to be discussed for setting Perl environment in both Linux and Windows, as there won’t be many library files included in this installation. You need to manually install those. You can install those manually using CPAN(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) or either PPM which works only for perl windows. But these files are not mandatory to start coding in Perl. 
Apart from this windows setup you could use Windows 10’s new feature of Linux subsystem over windows & use it for running perl code
First Perl Program
Don’t worry if you don’t understand this text. Everything will be clear soon. Come on and take a look at it by line:
This tells the Operating System to execute this file with the program located at /usr/bin/perl  Some IDEs don’t need this line. If it’s essential, you must write here a path to your interpreter. Remember! This special line must be at the beginning of your program and must starts from #! use warnings; This is another special command which tells the interpreter to display any warnings i.e.  -w which activates warnings globally.
The print instruction writes text to the screen. The semicolon at the end of the line tells the perl interpreter that the instruction is finished. You must put a semicolon at the end of every instruction in Perl code. Note the quotation mark(“). It’s necessary for print instruction. Save the above script as firstprog.pl
If you have Strawberry installed, you can simply click on Run. You can also run command-line interface and write on the console:
or, if perl.exe is not in your path:
You just have to open the Terminal and write:
If you can’t run the program, make sure you have eligibility to run it. Type in the Terminal:
Your program is now executable and ready to run. To execute, write:
Modules are set of codes that are used to do tasks that perform common operations in several programs. If you use perl modules, you do not have to rewrite the codes to perform that same operation. Perl can make use of such external libraries of codes. One of the best libraries is the CPAN. It stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and contains a vast amount of Perl modules for you to use. It is a community or network of a large number of developers who contribute such modules. By installing support for CPAN modules in your perl module, you can make use of the CPAN modules and make your work easier. Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use XS (they are written in C) so require a C compiler (it’s easy to get this setup – don’t panic. Modules may have dependencies on other modules (almost always on CPAN) and cannot be installed without them (or without a specific version of them). It is worth thoroughly reading the documentation for the options below. Many modules on CPAN now require a recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above). Install cpanminus a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN to make installing other modules easier (you’ll thank us later). To Install App-cpanminus perl modules, in the command line type:
cpan App::cpanminus Make sure you have internet connection while perl modules are being downloaded and installed.

Now install any module:
Let’s see an example of installing a module File::Data(It’s an Interface to access File Data).

Now, we’ll talk about variables. You can imagine variable like kind of container which holds one or more values. Once defined, the name of variable remains the same, but the value or values change over and over again. 



Types of Variables in Perl


The easiest ones are scalars, and this is ours today subject
This type of variable holds a single value.
Its name begins with a dollar sign and a Perl identifier (it’s the name of our variable).



Scalar variable in Perl


If you are familiar with other programming languages, then you would know that there are certain rules about naming variables. Similarly, Perl has three rules for naming scalars.
Perl Example:		
These, however, are not legal scalar variable names.
The general rule says, when Perl has just one of something, that’s a scalar. Scalars can be read from devices, and we can use it to our programs.
In this type of scalar data we could specify:
<img decoding="async" width="113" height="108" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/7-19-2013-5-36-53-PM.png" alt="Number variables in Perl" border="0">		
Notice: In general, Perl interpreter sees integers like floating points numbers. For example, if you write 2 in your programs, Perl will see it like 2.0000
It consists of one or more digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus and containing underscores.
Perl Examples:		
As you can see- it’s nothing special. But believe me, this is the most common type of scalars. They’re everywhere.
It consists of digits, optionally minus, decimal point and exponent.
Perl Examples:		
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="274" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071813_1105_Perlvariabl7.png" alt="Floating-point literals in Perl" border="0">		
It’s alternative to the decimal system. Allow me to show you Octal, Hexadecimal and Binary representation. A short table presents all important information about this weird styles:
Perl Examples:		
All of these values for Perl means the same. Perl doesn’t store the values in the same format. It will internally convert these hexadecimal, binary, octal to decimal values. 
The assignment is the most common operation on a scalar, and it’s very simple. Perl uses for that equal sign. It takes a value of the expression from the right side and puts this value to our variable.
Let’s take a look to examples:		
What’s more you can put in variable not only a number, but also an expression.		
Strings: It’s also very simple type of scalar.
The maximum length of a string in Perl depends upon the amount of memory the computer has. There is no limit to the size of the string, any amount of characters, symbols, or words can make up your strings. The shortest string has no characters. The longest can fill all of the system memory. Perl programs can be written entirely in 7-bit ASCII character set. Perl also permits you to add any 8-bit or 16-bit character set aka. non-ASCII characters within string literals. Perl has also added support for Unicode UTF-8. 
<img decoding="async" width="128" height="231" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/7-19-2013-5-41-16-PM.png" alt="Types of strings in Perl" border="0">		
Like numbers there are two different types of strings:
Single quotation marks are used to enclose data you want to be taken literally. A short example and everything should be clear:
Perl Examples:		
Output:
it is $num
Here due to single quotes value of $num in not taken and the literal characters ‘$’,’n’, ‘u’ & ‘m’ are added to the value of $txt
Double quotation marks are used to enclose data that needs to be interpolated before processing. That means that escaped characters and variables aren’t simply literally inserted into later operations, but are evaluated on the spot. Escape characters can be used to insert newlines, tabs, etc.
Perl Examples:		
Output:
it is 7
Here due to double quotes value of $num is taken added to the value of $txt
Double-quotes interpolate scalar and array variables, but not hashes. On the other hand, you can use double-quotes to interpolate slices of both arrays and hashes.
Mysterious \n
Consider the following program
Perl Examples:		
Output:
hello
Perl does not display just ‘hello\n’, but only ‘hello’. Why? Because ‘\n’ is a special sign and means that you want to go to a new line while displaying the text in your program. print “hello\n new line”; Next question- are there any other special sign? Yes, they are! But don’t worry- just a few. Check the table below
I know, there isn’t ‘just a few’… But believe me, you must to know just
It’s the same operation, which we see in numbers assignment. Perl gets our string from the right side of the equal sign and puts this string to a variable.
Perl Examples:		
Output:
tutorial315
As you can see, you can put numbers and strings in the same variables. There isn’t class of variables.
The concatenation operator “.” unites two or more strings. Remember! If the string contains quotes, carriage returns, backslashes, all these special characters need to be escaped with a backslash. 
Perl ‘ ‘ variable Examples:		
Output:
Tom is mother’s favorite cat
The strings
“$a”, “$b”, is concatenated & stored in “$c” using the “.” operator.		
In the end…
As you know, Perl automatically converts between numbers to string as needed. How does Perl know, what we need right now? This is simple- everything depends on the operator (we’ll talk about operators later, now, just accept there are a lot of operators, different for numbers and strings) If an operator expects a number, Perl will use the value as a number. If an operator expects a string, Perl will use the value as a string. In other words- you don’t need to worry about this kind of conversion. Short example and everything should be clear:
Perl Examples:		
Output:
71
the value of $string is converted to an integer and added to the value of $number.
The result of the addition, 71, is assigned to $result.		
Scope of a variable – Access Modifiers
We can declare a scalar in anywhere in the program. But you need to specify an access modifier
My: Using this you can declare any variable which is specific within the block. i.e. within the curly braces.
No Output
The output of the program will be nothing!
<img decoding="async" width="294" height="144" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071813_1105_Perlvariabl15.png" alt="PERL Tutorial for Beginners - Complete Guide" border="0">		
In the above example, you will see that there are two variables declared one is inside if block ($var_2) and the other is outside the If block ($var). The variable, which is declared outside the block will be accessible to if block but the variable which was declared inside if block won’t be accessible to the outer program.
Local: Using this we can actually mask the same variable values to different values without actually changing the original value of the variable, suppose we have a variable $a for which the value is assigned 5, you can actually change the value of that variable by re-declaring the same variable using local keyword without altering the original value of the variable which is 5. Let’s see how this works with an example.
The output of the above program will be in this manner.
local, $var = 3		
global, $var = 5		
This way we can change the value of the variable without affecting the original value.
Our: Once a variable is declared with access modifier “our” it can be used across the entire package. Suppose, you have Perl module or a package test.pm which has a variable declared with scope our. This variable can be accessed in any scripts which will use that package.
If you are serious about programming in Perl, you should begin your program with
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
This will help you write better and cleaner code. ‘use strict’ turns on strict pragma which will make you declare your variables with my keyword.
This is a good programming practice
Result: Error
Output:
10
An Array is a special type of variable which stores data in the form of a list; each element can be accessed using the index number which will be unique for each and every element. You can store numbers, strings, floating values, etc. in your array. This looks great, So how do we create an array in Perl? In Perl, you can define an array using ‘@’ character followed by the name that you want to give. Let’s consider defining an array in Perl.
my @array;
This is how we define an array in Perl; you might be thinking how we need to store data in it. There are different ways of storing data in an array. This depends on how you are going to use it.
Output:
abcd
This is an array with 4 elements in it.
The array index starts from 0 and ends to its maximum declared size, in this case, the max index size is 3.



Perl Array Example


You can also declare an array in the above way; the only difference is, it stores data into an array considering a white space to be the delimiter. Here, qw() means quote word. The significance of this function is to generate a list of words. You can use the qw in multiple ways to declare an array.
Output:
abcdpqrsvxyz
Suppose you want to assign a value to the 5th element of an array, how are we going to do that.
$array [4] =’e’;
Sequential arrays are those where you store data sequentially. Suppose, you want to store 1-10 numbers or alphabets a-z in an array. Instead of typing all the letters, you can try something like below –
Output:
12345678910
We have an array which is already available, and you don’t know what the size of that array is, so what is the possible way to find that.
Can we get the size of an array without using functions? Yes, we can.
Output:
5
5
The above method of declaring an array is called static arrays, where you know the size of an array.
 What is Dynamic Array?		
Dynamic arrays are those that you declare without specifying any value on them. So when exactly do we store values in that array? Simple, we store them during run time. Here is a simple program for that.
We will be using some inbuilt Perl functions for doing this task.
Output:
This is 
kind of dyn 
mic 
rr 
y
The split function splits the content of string into an array based on the delimiter provided to it. This function will also eliminate the delimiter from the string, in this case, it is ‘a’;
These functions can be used in Perl to add/delete to array elements.
<img decoding="async" width="515" height="200" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0537_Arrays4.png" alt="Array functions in Perl" border="0">		
Output:
1st : Mon Tue Wed
2nd when push : Mon Tue Wed Thu
3rd when unshift : Fri Mon Tue Wed Thu
4th when pop : Fri Mon Tue Wed
5th when shift : Mon Tue Wed
We already learned about scalars and arrays in previous sections.
What exactly scalars do? It only stores integers and strings.
What exactly arrays do? It is a collection of scalars, where you access each element of an array using indices. But, is this good idea to use an array when you have hundreds and thousands of records? We will forget which index has what value. To overcome this situation we have something like perl hash.
A hash can also hold as many scalars as the array can hold. The only difference is we don’t have any index rather we have keys and values. A hash can be declared, starting with % followed by the name of the hash. Let’s see an example how we can define a Perl hash and how we can differentiate this from array
Consider an example of three people and their ages are represented in an array.
Output:
Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25
This way it is difficult to know individual ages as we need to remember both index locations of name and age of all the people. It may be simple when you have 3 names, but when you have 1000 or more? You know the answer.
<img decoding="async" width="460" height="312" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0921_PerlHashes2.png" alt="Hashes in Perl" border="0">	
This we can overcome using a hash.
Hash Example:
Output:
Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25
We have now declared a hash, great!! But, how do we access or print it? Each element in hash should be accessed with its associated key for which there will be a value assigned. So, there is a one-one mapping between each of the key and value in the hash.
In order to print the age of any person, you just need to remember the name of that person.
You might have wondered why I used $hash{KeyName}, remember a hash is a collection of scalars again. So, we can use $ which represents scalar to access each hash element.
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="331" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0921_PerlHashes3.png" alt="Example of Hash in Perl" border="0">		
Note: Each Key in hash should be unique or else it will override your value, which was assigned previously.
How can we assign a hash to another hash? Simple, same way as we do for 
We can also print entire hash.
Output:
Tom23
As you can see we already have a hash %newHash, and now we need to add more entries into it.
Output:
Jim25John26Harry27
You may want to delete an entry from a hash. This is how we can do that.
Delete is an inbuilt function of Perl. Here, we will see an example of assigning a hash to an array.
Note: Whenever you print a hash or when you store hash into an array. The order may always differ. It’s not the same always.
We can assign only keys or values of a hash to an array.
To remove all the entries in the hash, we can directly assign the hash to null.
%newHash=();# This will redefine the hash with no entries.
We can use conditional Statements in Perl. So, what are conditional statements? Conditional statements are those, where you actually check for some circumstances to be satisfied in your code.
Think about an example, you are buying some fruits, and you don’t like the price to be more than 100 bucks. So, the rule here is 100 bucks.
Perl supports two types of conditional statements; they are if and unless.
If code block will be executed, when the condition is true.
<img decoding="async" width="374" height="232" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0932_Conditional1.png" alt="Perl Conditional Statements" border="0">		
Output:
5
This looks good. Let us think about a situation where $a is not 5.
Output:
The value is 10 —FAIL			
This way we can control only one condition at a time. Is it a limitation? No, you can also control various conditions using if… elsif … else.
Output:
Executed elsif block –The value is 5
In the above case, the elsif block will be executed as $a is equal to 5.
There could be situations where both if and elsif code blocks will be failed. In this scenario, the else code block will be executed. You can actually eliminate the else code check if you don’t like to include.
In this case, you can use if code block in one more if code block.
Output:
Inside 1st else block – The value is 11
Execute the same code by change the value of $a; you can find out the rest.		
You have already got an idea what if does (If the condition is true it will execute the code block). Unless is opposite to if, unless code block will be executed if the condition is false.
Output:
Inside 1st else block – The value is 5
Guess what will be the output. You are right!!!!!. The output will be the print statement of the else block. Because of the condition in unless code block is true, remember unless block will be executed only if the condition is false. Change the value of $a and execute the code you will see the difference.
Output:
Inside else block
Output:
Inside unless Block
Perl supports control structures similar to other programming languages. Perl supports four types of control structures for, foreach, while and until. We use these statements to, repeatedly execute some code.
For code block will execute till the condition is satisfied. Let’s take an example of how to Perl loop an array.
Output:
The array index 0 value is 1
The array index 1 value is 2
The array index 2 value is 3
The array index 3 value is 4
The array index 4 value is 5
The array index 5 value is 6
The array index 6 value is 7
The array index 7 value is 8
The array index 8 value is 9
The array index 9 value is 10
Here, in for () expression, there are many statements included. There is a meaning for each of them.
Here is another way of using for.
Output:
1n
 2n
 3n
 4n
  5n
  6n
  7n
 8n
  9n
  10n
The for each statement can be used in the same way as for; the main difference is we don’t have any condition check and incrementing in this.
Let’s take the same example with foreach perl.
Output:
The value is 1
 The value is 2
 The value is 3
The value is 4
 The value is 5
 The value is 6
 The value is 7
  The value is 8
 The value is 9
 The value is 10
Foreach takes each element of an array and assigns that value to $var for every iteration. We can also use $_ for the same.
Output:
The value is 1
 The value is 2
 The value is 3
The value is 4
 The value is 5
 The value is 6
 The value is 7
  The value is 8
 The value is 9
 The value is 10
This looks good for accessing arrays. How about Hashes, how can we obtain hash keys and values using foreach?
We can use foreach to access keys and values of the hash by looping it.
<img decoding="async" width="227" height="230" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_1015_PerlControl2.png" alt="For loop in Perl" border="0">		
Output:
Mickey
Tom
Jerry
You might be wondering, Why we used Keys in foreach(). Keys is an inbuilt function of Perl where we can quickly access the keys of the hash. How about values? We can use values function for accessing values of the hash.
Output:
the value is 24
 the value is 23 
the value is 25 
The Perl While loop is a control structure, where the code block will be executed till the condition is true.
The code block will exit only if the condition is false.
Let’s take an example for Perl While loop.
<img decoding="async" width="265" height="265" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_1015_PerlControl4.png" alt="While loop in Perl" border="0">		
Here is a problem, which will require input from the user and will not exit until the number provided as ‘7’.
Output:
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
9
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
 5
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
 7
You guessed the lucky number 7
In the above example, the while condition will not be true if we enter input other than ‘7’.
If you see how while works here, the code block will execute only if the condition in a while is true.
Do while loop will execute at least once even if the condition in the while section is false.
Let’s take the same example by using do while.
Output:
10 
  9
  8 
 7 
  6 
  5 
  4 
  3 
  2 
  1 
  Now value is less than 1
Until code block is similar to unless in a conditional statement. Here, the code block will execute only if the condition in until block is false.  
Let’s take the same example which we used in case of a while.
Here is a problem, which will require input from the user and will not exit until the name provided as other than ‘sai’.
Output:
Enter any name sai
Do until can be used only when we need a condition to be false, and it should be executed at-least once.
Output:
Enter any name Howard
Enter any name Sheldon
Enter any name sai
Execute while, do-while, until and do-until example codes to see the difference.
Operators in computer language indicate an action that can be performed on some set of variables or values which computer can understand. Perl has incorporated most of the Operators from C language. Perl has many operators compared with other programming languages. Operators are categorized as Arithmetic, Logical, relational and assignment operators.
Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are those which can be used to perform some basic mathematic operations. These Arithmetic operators are binary operators where we need two arguments to perform a basic operation. We can also use unary operators for other basic operations; you can see the difference in examples below.
+
Addition operation used for adding two values or variables
holding values
$x=5+6; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x+$y;
–
Subtraction operator used for subtracting two values or variables holding values
$x=6-5; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x-$y;
*
Multiplication operator used for multiply two values or variables holding values
$x=6*5; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x*$y;
/
Division operator used for divide two values or variables holding values
$x=36/6; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x/$y;
**
The exponential operator used for provide exponent and get the value.
Ex : 22 = 4, 33 = 27
$x=5**5; # or
$x=4;
$y=2;
$z=$x**$y;
%
Modulus operator used to get the reminder during division of two values or variables holding values
$x=5%2; # or
$x=10;
$y=2;
$z=$x % $y;
++
Unary addition operator to increment value of a variable by 1
$x=5;
$x++;
Or
++$x;
—
Unary Subtraction operator to decrement value of a variable by 1
$x=5;
$x–; # post decrement
Or
–$x;# pre decrement
Example to complete all the above operations.
Output:
Add of 10 and 2 is 12
Sub of 10 and 2 is 8
Mul of 10 and 2 is 20
Div of 10 and 2 is 5
Exp of 10 and 2 is 100
Mod of 10 and 2 is 0
Assignment operators simply assign values to variables, but there is one more thing which we need to remember here, assignment operators will also perform arithmetic operations and assign the new value to the same variable on which the operation is performed.
+=
Addition operator used for adding and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x+=10;
-=
Subtraction operator used for subtracting and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x-=10;
*=
Multiplication operator used for adding and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x*=10;
/=
Division operator used for dividing and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x/=10;
**=
Exponential operator used for getting exponent and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x**=10;
%=
Modulus operator used for getting a reminder during division and assigning the value to the same variable
$x=10;
$x%=4;
Example to complete all the above operations.
Output:
Add = 15
Sub= 10
Mul = 50
Div = 10
Perl uses logical operators to compare numbers and strings. Most of the time logical operators are used in Conditional Statements.



Logical and Relational Operators in Perl


==or eq
Operator used to check whether both variables are equal
!=Or ne
Operator used to check whether both variables are not equal
> or gt
Operator used to check whether
A is greater than B
<or lt
Operator used to check whether
A is less than B
>=or ge
Operator used to check whether
A is greater than or equal to B
<=or le
Operator used to check whether
A is less than or equal to B
|| or or
Operator used to check either A or B is holding value
&&or and
Operator used to check both A and B is holding value
Let us take an example where we can explain all the scenarios.
Output:
True — equal 5 and 5
  True — not equal 6 and 7
  True — 7 greater than 6
  True — 6 less than 7
  True — 6 less than 7
 True — 7 greater than 6
You can see examples of logical operators in later sections.
Special variables in Perl are those who have some predefined meaning. These variables denoted with either real Name or Punctuation symbols. We have a special variable for all the Perl supported Variables like scalar special variables, Array special variables, hash special variables. Most of the special variables that we use are of scalars.
When we want to use the special variable with its name, then we have to load a Perl module ‘use English,’ to explicitly say Perl interpreter that we are going to use special variables using its Name.
$_$ARG
This is the default variable which stores the current values.
$0 or $PROGRAM_NAME
Stores the file name of the Perl script.
$/
The input record separator, this has a default value of ‘\n’ which is newline character
$.
Holds the current line number of the file that is being read
$,
Output field separator, this is mainly used by the print() statement. By default value of this is set to 0, we can change the value of this variable.
$\
Output record separator, the value of this variable will be empty; we can assign any value to this, which will be used by print() statement while printing the output.
$#
This variable is used for output format while printing numbers.

$?
Status code : Pipe and system call. The return status of the command executed.
$&$MATCH
Used in regular expressions, this will hold a string of the last successful pattern match.

$^W$WARNING
The current value of the –w command line switch. Warning switch.
$ARGV

%ENV
System environmental variables.
%SIG
Signals handler.
Perl regular expression is strong enough in matching the string patterns within a statements or group of statements. Regular expressions are mostly used in text parsing, pattern matching and much more based on the requirement. We have certain operators, which are specially used by regular expression pattern binding =~ and !~, These are test and assignment operators.



Regular Expression Operators in Perl


Before going further, We need to know few things about regular expression; there are certain things like Meta characters, wildcards in Perl Regex syntax.
\
Special or quote
*

\n
Match newline
The above are the set of characters which can be used during pattern matching.
Let’s see few examples.
Consider a situation where user provides some input during script execution, and we want to check whether the user entered some name as input or not. We have to write a regular expression syntax to extract your name and print the same.
Output:
Found Pattern
Here, we have written the regular expression as /.*(Guru99).*/.* match all characters in a string. A ‘.’ in perl regex match refers to any character including space.
Let us see how exactly we can construct a Regex.
Consider an example of a string of multiple words and digits and special symbols like this “Hello everyone this is my number: +91-99298373639”;
Regex : /^\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\:\+\d+\-\d+/i 
Word space word space word space word space word space word space special character : space special character+digits special character –digits.
The match operators are used to match a string within some statement or in a variable.
Output:
true
This small code will print ‘true’, as the perl pattern matching identifies the string in a variable. Basically, Perl searches for the text provided in // throughout the string, even if it finds in one place it will return ‘true’. The pattern can be anywhere in the variable. We can try replacing =~ with !~ to see the difference between those two operators.
This operator can be used for searching and replacing any character with either null or some other character.
Output:
cello how are you
Note: We can actually use any pattern matching string as we did earlier in this substitution operator as well. Here we used ‘gi’, g-globally, i-ignore case.
This is similar to Substitution, but it does not use any perl regular expressions, rather we can directly pass the value or a word which we want to replace.
Output:
Hello cow are you
Perl was designed to manipulate files and I/O operations effectively. Perl main advantage is in file parsing and handling the files. There are many inbuilt functions and operators used during file handling in Perl.
Basically, file operations that are performed with Perl are done using FILEHANDLE. We have to define this FILEHANDLE during the opening a file for either read or write.
In this Perl script tutorial, you will learn-		
We can open a file using open() function available in Perl.
Now we have opened a file, now a question arises. Is it for reading or writing?
Perl has certain modes, which need to be used to read, write or append a file.
Few examples for reading a file:

Consider we have a perl file with name file.txt and has few lines of text in it. We need to open this file and print the same.
or		
This will print the file content on the output screen.

Now, we will write a program to create and write data to a perl file.		
<img decoding="async" width="400" height="287" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0641_PerlFileHan2.png" alt="Writing file in Perl" border="0">		
This will write the input provided during run-time and creates a file test.txt which will have input.
The above way will always try to create a file named test.txt and writes the input into the file; we will write the same to append the file.

Now that we have to see how to read, write and append files using basic examples.
We will see few more examples and other functions which help in understanding more about files.		
This method will return the current position of FILEHANDLER in bytes if specified else it will consider the last line as the position.		
Seek function is similar to the fseek system call. This method is used to position the file pointer to a specific location by specifying the bytes followed by either start of the file pointer or end of the file pointer.		
WHENCE is the position of the file pointer to start. Zero will set it from the beginning of the file.
Example:Let input.txt has some data like “Hello this is my world.”		
Output:
this is my world
Unlink is used to delete the file.		
We can also handle directories through which we can handle multiple files.
let’s see how to open a directory. We can use the opendir and readdir methods.		
or		
This will print all the available files in that directory.		
-r

Subroutines are similar to functions in other programming languages. We have already used some built-in functions like print, chomp, chop, etc. We can write our own subroutines in Perl. These subroutines can be written anywhere in the program; it is preferable to place the subroutines either at the beginning or at the end of the code. 
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0647_PerlSubrout1.png" alt="Subroutine in PERL" border="0">		
Now that, we know how to write a subroutine, how do we access it?
We need to access or call a subroutine using the subroutine name prefixed with ‘&’ symbol.
Subroutines or perl function are written to place the reusable code in it. Most of the reusable code requires parameters to be passed to the subroutine. Here, we will learn how we can pass arguments to the subroutine.
Output:
3 is the value passed
@_ is a special array variable which stores the arguments passed to the subroutines.
We can also use ‘shift’ keyword which shifts one parameter at a time to a variable or $_[0],$_[1]… which is an individual element of @_ array
Output:
hello is passed
Subroutines are typically used in object-oriented programming and also in places where you may have more reusable code to be placed.
Main functionality of subroutines is to do some task and return the result of the reusable code.
<img decoding="async" width="824" height="611" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/030217_0620_PerlTutoria39.png" alt="PERL Tutorial for Beginners - Complete Guide">		
We can return a value from subroutine using the return keyword.
Output:
11
$result will be holding the value of the $a and $b added.
We can also pass hashes and array directly to the subroutine.
Output:
1a2b
We can also return a hash or an array.
Output:
Inside Sub-routine2b1aAfter Sub-routine call2b1a
Perl has a mechanism using which we can generate reports. Using this feature, we can make reports exactly the way we want while printing on the Output screen or in a file. A simple format can be written using printf or sprintf functions available in Perl.
This will include leading zeros in front of number 30 making a total count of digits to 5. The same can be used for sprintf.
Using printf and sprintf, we can obtain most of the Perl formats. In the case of reports, it will be difficult to implement.
<img decoding="async" width="400" height="221" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0651_PerlFormats1.jpg" alt="Perl Format" border="0">




	===========================================================================
	Name            Address            Age            Phone
	===========================================================================
	Krishna            Chennai        24            929309242
	Shruthi            Chennai        24            929309232
	The above is a example reports that we need to print in the same manner in Perl. This can be achieved by using the perl printf and perl sprintf. It can effectively be implemented using format.
	A format can be declared in the below manner.

Here, we will be using a particular method write to print the data onto output screen or into the file.
@
Used to represent the start of the field holder
>
Right alignment of text
<
Left alignment of text
|
Center alignment
#
Numeric if multiple # provided. Assumes as a comment if single # provided
.
Decimal point
^
Start of field holder can also be used for multiline and also for the word-wrap
~
Line should be empty if the variable is empty
@*
Multiple lines.
Execute the code to see the output.
We are using @ symbol to specify the start of the field holder or string, ‘<‘ each character. 
We are using STDOUT to print on the standard output. We can change this to file handler which we are using to write data into the file.
We can replace ‘<‘ to ‘>’ or ‘|’ to change the alignment of the text.STDOUT_TOP is used to design the header of the format.We can also use the same with file handler using FH_TOP( FH is the file handler).This will output the format to the file which we are working on.
Each programmer will have his own sense of writing the code using certain standards; these standards should be familiar enough that other programmer can understand and support the code properly.



Coding Standards in Perl


Writing code is simple and easy. The problem arises when it needs to be maintained at later stages. Proper guidelines and coding standards need to be followed while writing the code. Perl also defines certain standards that will be useful for programmers to write code. It is advisable to load ‘strict’ and ‘warnings module’ while writing the code. Each of these modules has its own importance. Strict will make us declare the variable before using and also will tell if any bare word present in your code. Warnings module can alternatively be used by passing ‘-w’ option to the Perl interpreter in shebang. Warnings will print on the output screen.
Below are few lists of standards.
Ex: open(FH, <file.txt”) or die(“cannot open the file $!”);				
Perfect example with coding standards:
An exception is an event that occurs during the program execution which will suspend or terminate your program.
Error Handling is one which every programmer has to take care during programming. Perl also provides error handling techniques with which we can trap the error and handle those accordingly.



Error Handling in Perl


There are many ways to check for error in the program. We need to examine the return codes of the function that we are using code. If we are able to handle those return codes properly, then most of the error handling can be achieved.
What will return in case of system calls?
In the case of system calls, the return status will get stored in two special variables $? And $!
$! – This will catch the error number or error number associated with the error message.
$? – This will hold the return status system() function.
We can use logical or operator for error handling while using system calls.
Ex:
This will open the file in read mode if the file exists.
What if the file is missing?
Eval function can handle fatal errors, compile time errors, runtime errors and those errors which terminates your code at some point in time.
Perl Eval function can have a block of code or an expression. Evals considers everything placed in it as a string.
Consider a situation of calling a subroutine which is not defined in the script. In this situation, the script terminates stating “undefined subroutine &XYZ, this error can be handled in the eval function.
There are many uses of evals block; one such use is when we want to load the module which is specific to the operating system during runtime.
Ex: Divide by zero causes a fatal error; to handle this we can place the code in evals block.
Output:
syntax error at C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl line 8, near “)
{“
Execution of C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
Example: eval using perl die statement.
Output:
Caught : Dieing in sub test
Perl does not support try, catch and finally code blocks as other programming languages. We can still use them by loading an external Perl module.
use Try::Tiny;
Using this we can place your code in try block and catch the error in warn block.
In place of $@ used in eval Try::Tiny uses $_.
# handle errors with a catch handler
Output:
foo at C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl line 4.
We can use try, catch and finally in this manner.
try { # statement }
catch {# statement }
finally { # statement };
Or		
Output:

The socket is a medium through which two computers can interact on a network by using network address and ports.
Suppose, A (Server) and B (Client) are two systems, which has to interact with each other using Sockets for running some programs.
To implements this we need to create sockets in both A (Server) and B (Client), A will be in the receiving state and B will be in the sending state.
Here, the server wishes to receive a connection from B (Client) and execute some tasks and send the result back to B (Client). When we execute the code, the operating system in A tries to create a socket and binds one port to that socket. Then it will listen from the sender which is B.
Here, the client wishes to send some program from his system to A (Server) for some processing. When we execute the code, the operating system in B tries to create a socket for communicating with A (Server), B has to specify the IP address and the port number of A to which B wishes to connect.
If this goes well, both systems will interact to exchange the information through one port. Perl also supports socket programming.
Perl has a native API through which sockets can be implemented. To make it easy, there are many CPAN modules using which we write socket programs.
<img decoding="async" width="610" height="266" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0659_PerlSocketP2.png" alt="Client-Server Operations in Perl" border="0">		
This is one module for socket programming, which is based on object oriented programming. This module does not support the INET network type used in networks.
This module supports INET domain and is built upon IO::Sockets. All the methods available in IO::Sockets are inherited in INET module.
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol; we will be using this protocol for socket programming.
Before proceeding further let’s see how can we create an object for IO::Socket::INET module and create a socket.
The new method in IO::Socket::INET module accepts a hash as an input parameter to the subroutine. This hash is predefined, and we just need to provide the values to the keys which we want to use. There is a list of keys used by this hash.
PeerAddr
Remote host address
PeerHost
Synonym for PeerAddr
PeerPort
Remote port or service
LocalAddr
Local host bind address
LocalHost
Synonym for LocalAddr
LocalPort
Local host bind port
Proto
Protocol name (or number)
Type
Socket type
Listen
Queue size for listen
ReuseAddr
Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
Reuse
Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
ReusePort
Set SO_REUSEPORT before binding
Broadcast
Set SO_BROADCAST before binding
Timeout
Timeout value for various operations
MultiHomed
Try all addresses for multihomed hosts
Blocking
Determine if connection will be blocking mode
Note:
In socket programming, we will have to execute Server.pl first and then client.pl individually in different command prompts if we are running on local host.
Modules and Packages are closely related to each other and are independent. Package: A Perl package is also known as namespace and which have all unique variables used like hashes, arrays, scalars, and subroutines. Module: Module is a collection of reusable code, where we write subroutines in it. These modules can be loaded in Perl programs to make use of the subroutines written in those modules.
Standard modules will get installed during installation of Perl on any system. CPAN: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network – A global repository of Perl modules. Our own customized Perl Modules which can be written by us. Basically, A module when loaded in any script will export all its global variables and subroutines. These subroutines can directly call as if they were declared in the script itself. Perl Modules can be written with .pm extension to the filename Ex : Foo.pm. A module can be written by using ‘package Foo’ at the beginning of the program.
No Output
To use this Perl module, we have to place it in currently working directory.
We can load a Perl module using require or use anywhere in the code. The major difference between require and use is, require loaded module during runtime and use loads during compile time.
Here, in the above example, we are accessing the subroutines using fully qualified module name.
We can also access the package using ‘use Arithmetic’.
This module has a default functionality of importing methods.
@EXPORT array can be used to pass a list of variables and subroutines which by default will be exported to the caller of the Module.
@EXPORT_OK array can be used to pass a list of variables and subroutines which will be exported on demand basis, where the user has to specify while loading the module.
By default, add subroutine will be exported. Subtract method won’t be exported if it not specified while loading the module.
In this section, we will learn how to create Perl Object oriented Modules. First, let’s see what is the object? An object is an instance using which we can access, modify and locate some data in any Perl module. This is nothing but making your existing Perl package, variables and subroutines to act like class, objects, and methods in reference to other Programming Languages.
We already know how to create modules from the previous topic. The purpose of the class is to store methods and variables. A Perl Module will have subroutines which are methods. We need to access those variables and subroutines objects.
A constructor in Perl is a method which will execute and return us a reference with the module name tagged to the reference. This is called as blessing the class. We use a particular variable for blessing a perl class, which is bless.
The new method used as a constructor for a class, This constructor will create an object for us and will return to the script which is calling this constructor.
Here, we need to understand how the object created. Whenever we try to create an object for the class, we need to use the full name of the class. Suppose, if the perl class is located in some lib\Math\Arithmetic.pm. And, if we want to access this perl class from the lib directory then we have to provide the entire path of to the class while calling in the script.
This is how the object creation in Perl happens.
How does Perl script know where library module exists? Perl only knows about current directory of the script and the Perl inbuilt library path. Whenever we use, and Perl module, which is not located in the current directory or Perl library Path, the script will always fail. About @INC, this is an array, which holds all directory paths where it has to look for the Perl modules. Try to execute this command and see what will be the output.
This will give some output, and that is the path where the lib Modules will be available. Whenever we use any new library module, we need to tell Perl, interpreter, to look into that particular location where Perl module is available.
Make this as your first line of code. This will tell your interpreter to look into that Path. or use		
The destructor of an object is by default called at the end and before your script exits. This is used to destroy your objects from memory.

Perl is widely used in automation. It may not be the best programming languages in the world but its best suited for certain types of tasks. Let’s discuss where & why Perl is used for Automation Testing.
<img decoding="async" title="How PERL is used in Automation Testing" alt="Storage Testing using Perl" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/PERLinAutomationTesting1.png" style="float: left;">

					What is Storage? Data stored in Files.

					Suppose, we have a Storage related Test Case where we have to write data on one partition, read it & verify that the data is written correctly.

					This can be done manually, but can a manual tester perform the same 10000 times? It will be a nightmare! We need automation

	Best tool to automate anything related to storage is Perl because of its File Handling Techniques, REGEX and powerful file parsing which consumes least execution time compared to other programming languages.

	Why we need to test storage? Think about large Data Centers where data will be flowing continuously from one system to other system with 1000’s of records being stored per second. Testing robustness of such storage mechanism is essential.

	Many companies like HP, Dell, IBM and many server manufacture use Perl as an interface to test functionality in Storage and Networking domains. NetApp is one such company which completely works on Storage and uses Perl as the Programming language to automate the test cases.

	If you are interested in Perl Automation, then it would be advisable to learn about Storage & Networking Concepts.



Server and Network Testing using Perl



	PERL is widely used in server uptime and performance monitoring.

	Consider a data center which has 100 hosts(servers). You are required to connect to each host, execute some commands remotely. You also want to reboot the system and check when it comes back online.

	Manually doing this task for all 100 hosts will be a nightmare. But we can easily automate this using PERL

	Design steps to achieve this above automation using PERL

	We will code the above scenario.

	Let’s take a file called Input.txt which will store the complete info about all the hosts in which we need to connect and execute the command.

	Input.txt

	192.168.1.2 root password

	192.168.1.3 root password

	192.168.1.4 root root123
HostCheck.pl

	Web Testing

  Perl is not only restricted to Storage & Network testing. We can also perform Web-based testing using PERL. WWW-Mechanize is one module used for web testing. Basically, it won’t launch any browser to test the functionality of web application’s rather it uses the source code of the html pages.
We can also perform browser based testing using Selenium IDE, RC, Web driver. Perl is supported for Selenium.

This JavaScript for beginners tutorial is for students who want to learn about Web application development and software development. This tutorial is also helpful for the professionals working in web application development to enhance their knowledge and skills.
JavaScript is the most popular client-side programming language which is widely used for web application development in every industry. There is a huge demand in the IT industry for candidates having knowledge of JavaScript. Therefore, learning JavaScript is beneficial for you to get a good job and also enhance your skills and knowledge as well.
JavaScript Engines are complicated. But it works on some simple basics:
Here, JavaScript engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It reads a compiled script and analyzes the data that passes in JavaScript engine. After that, it applies optimizations to the machine code from that acquired knowledge. When this process is completed, scripts run quite fast.
JavaScript’s functionality depends on the environment it’s running in. For example, Node.js supports functions which allows JavaScript to read and write  arbitrary files, perform network requests, object-oriented, etc. The roles that JavaScript plays in both client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) development of applications can vary wildly.
In-browser JavaScript also allows you to perform webpage manipulation, interaction with the user and with the web server.
JavaScript’s capabilities in the browser are quite limited for the sake of the user’s safety. It helps to prevent any unauthorized webpage from accessing private information.
Examples of such limitations are: 
Here, are the three most important features which make JavaScript unique

The syntax of JavaScript not suited for everyone as different project demands different features. However, some modern tools like a Coffee script, Typescript, and Dart allowing developers to code in another language and then auto-convert into the JavaScript code.
ECMAScript is a specification governed by ECMA international aimed at standardizing JavaScript. The latest version is ECMA9 also called JavaScript 9. It is supported by all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. Though each browser has an array of unique commands that are not part of the standards.

Before we learn Embedded System, lets learn:
A system is an arrangement where all its component work according to the specific defined rules. It is a method of organizing, working, or performing one or more tasks according to a fixed plan.
Embedded System is a combination of computer software and hardware which is either fixed in capability or programmable. An embedded system can be either an independent system, or it can be a part of a large system. It is mostly designed for a specific function or functions within a larger system. For example, a fire alarm is a common example of an embedded system which can sense only smoke.
Laser Printers are one of the examples of Embedded Systems which uses embedded systems to manage various aspect of the printing. Apart from performing the main task of printing, it has to take user inputs, manage communication with the computer system, to handle faults, and sense papers left on the tray, etc.
Here, the main task of the microprocessor is to understand the text and control the printing head in such a way that it discharges ink where it is needed.
To perform this, it needs to decode the different files given to it and understand the font and graphics. It will consume substantial CPU time to process the data as well as it has to take user inputs, control motors, etc.
Here, are important milestones from the history of embedded system:
Following are important characteristics of an embedded system:
Now in this Embedded Systems tutorial, we will cover some important terms used in embedded system.
This measure of the survival probability of the system when the function is critical during the run time.
Fault-Tolerance is the capability of a computer system to survive in the presence of faults.
Embedded system must meet various timing and other constraints. They are imposed on it by the real-time natural behavior of the external world.
For example, an airforce department which keeps track of incoming missile attacks must precisely calculate and plan their counter-attack due to hard real-time deadline. Otherwise, it’ll get destroyed.
It’s building systems with built-in debugging opportunities which allows remote maintenance.  
For example, you are building a spacecraft which will land on another planter to collect various types of data and send collected detail back to us. If this spacecraft went insane and lost the control, we should be able to make some important diagnostic. So, flexibility is vital while designing an embedded system.
Portability is a measure of the ease of using the same embedded software in various environments. It requires generalized abstractions between the application program logic itself and the low-level system interfaces.
A microcontroller is a single-chip VLSI unit which is also called microcomputer. It contains all the memory and I/O interfaces needed, whereas a general-purpose microprocessor needs additional chips to offered by these necessary functions. Microcontrollers are widely used in embedded systems for real-time control applications.
A microprocessor is a single chip semiconductor device. Its CPU contains a program counter, an ALU a stack pointer, working register, a clock timing circuit. It also includes ROM and RAM, memory decoder, and many serial and parallel ports.
Below is basic architecture of the Embedded System:
Sensor helps you to measures the physical quantity and converts it to an electrical signal. It also stores the measured quantity to the memory. This signal can be ready by an observer or by any electronic instrument such as A2D converter.
A-D converter (analog-to-digital converter) allows you to convert an analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.
Memory is used to store information. Embedded System majorly contains two memory cells 1) Volatile 2) Non volatile memory.
This component processes the data to measure the output and store it to the memory.
D-A converter (A digital-to-analog converter) helps you to convert the digital data fed by the processor to analog data.

Go (also known as Golang) is an open source programming language developed by Google. It is a statically-typed compiled language. Go supports concurrent programming, i.e. it allows running multiple processes simultaneously. This is achieved using channels, goroutines, etc. Go Language has garbage collection which itself does the memory management and allows the deferred execution of functions.
We will learn all the basics of Golang in this Learn Go Language Tutorial.
Step 1) Go to https://golang.org/dl/. Download the binary for your OS.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="700" height="215" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi1.png" alt="">		
Step 2)  Double click on the installer and click Run. 
<img decoding="async" width="415" height="311" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi2.png" alt="">		
Step 3) Click Next
<img decoding="async" width="509" height="391" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi3.png" alt="">		
Step 4) Select the installation folder and click Next.
<img decoding="async" width="479" height="398" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi4.png" alt="">		
Step 5) Click Finish once the installation is complete.
<img decoding="async" width="502" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi5.png" alt="">		
Step 6)  Once the installation is complete you can verify it by opening the terminal and typing
This will display the version of go installed
<img decoding="async" width="355" height="97" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi6.png" alt="">		
Create a folder called studyGo. In this Go language tutorial, we will create our go programs inside this folder. Go files are created with the extension .go. You can run Go programs using the syntax
Create a file called first.go and add the below code into it and save
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="411" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi7.png" alt="">		
Navigate to this folder in your terminal. Run the program using the command
    go run first.go
You can see the output printing
<img decoding="async" width="655" height="185" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi8.png" alt="">			
Now let’s discuss the above program.
package main – Every Go Language program should start with a package name. Go allows us to use packages in another go programs and hence supports code reusability. Execution of a Go program begins with the code inside the package named main.			
import fmt – imports the package fmt. This package implements the I/O functions.
func main() – This is the function from which program execution begins. The main function should always be placed in the main package. Under the main(), You can write the code inside { }.
fmt.Println – This will print the text on the screen by the Println function of fmt.
Note: In the below sections of this Go tutorial, when You mention execute/run the code, it means to save the code in a file with .go extension and run it using the syntax
Types(data types) represent the type of the value stored in a variable, type of the value a function returns, etc.
There are three basic types in Go Language
Numeric types – Represent numeric values which includes integer, floating point, and complex values. Various numeric types are:
int8 – 8 bit signed integers.
int16 – 16 bit signed integers.
int32 – 32 bit signed integers.
int64 – 64 bit signed integers.
uint8 – 8 bit unsigned integers.
uint16 – 16 bit unsigned integers.
uint32 – 32 bit unsigned integers.
uint64 – 64 bit unsigned integers.
float32 – 32 bit floating point numbers.
float64 – 64 bit floating point numbers.
complex64 – has float32 real and imaginary parts.
complex128 – has float32 real and imaginary parts.
String types – Represents a sequence of bytes(characters). You can do various operations on strings like string concatenation, extracting substring, etc
Boolean types –  Represents 2 values, either true or false.
Golang Interface is a collection of method signatures used by a Type to implement the behavior of objects. The main goal of Golang interface is to provide method signatures with names, arguments, and return types. It is up to a Type to declare and implement the method. An interface in Golang can be declared using the keyword “interface.”
Variables point to a memory location which stores some kind of value. The type parameter(in the below syntax) represents the type of value that can be stored in the memory location.
Variable can be declared using the syntax
Once You declare a variable of a type You can assign the variable to any value of that type.
You can also give an initial value to a variable during the declaration itself using 
If You declare the variable with an initial value, Go an infer the type of the variable from the type of value assigned. So You can omit the type during the declaration using the syntax
Also, You can declare multiple variables with the syntax
The below program in this Go tutorial has some Golang examples of variable declarations 
The output will be
Go Language also provides an easy way of declaring the variables with value by omitting the var keyword using
Note that You used := instead of =.  You cannot use := just to assign a value to a variable which is already declared. := is used to declare and assign value.
Create a file called assign.go with the following code 
Execute go run assign.go to see the result as
Variables declared without an initial value will have of 0 for numeric types, false for Boolean and empty string for strings
Constant variables are those variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned. A constant in Go programming language is declared by using the keyword “const”
Create a file called constant.go and with the following code
Execute go run constant.go to see the result as
Loops are used to execute a block of statements repeatedly based on a condition. Most of the programming languages provide 3 types of loops – for, while, do while. But Go programming language supports only for loop.		
The syntax of a Golang for loop is 
The initialisation_expression is executed first(and only once) in Golang for loop. 
Then the evaluation_expression is evaluated and if it’s true the code inside the block is executed.
The iteration_expression id is executed, and the evaluation_expression is evaluated again. If it’s true the statement block gets executed again. This will continue until the evaluation_expression becomes false.
Copy the below program into a file and execute it to see the Golang for loop printing numbers from 1 to 5
Output is 
If else is a conditional statement. The synax is 
Here the condition is evaluated and if it’s true statements_1 will be executed else statements_2 will be executed.
You can use if statement without else also. You also can have chained if else statements. The below programs will explain more about if else.
Execute the below program. It checks if a number, x, is less than 10. If so, it will print “x is less than 10”
Here since the value of x is greater than 10, the statement inside if block condition will not executed.
Now see the below program. In this Go programming language tutorial, we have an else block which will get executed on the failure of if evaluation.
This program will give you output
Now in this Go tutorial, we will see a program with multiple if else blocks(chained if else). Execute the below Go example. It checks whether a number is less than 10 or is between 10-90 or greater than 90.
Here first the if condition checks whether x is less than 10 and it’s not. So it checks the next condition(else if) whether it’s between 10 and 90 which is also false. So it then executes the block under the else section which gives the output
Switch is another conditional statement. Switch statements evaluate an expression and the result is compared against a set of available values(cases). Once a match is found the statements associated with that match(case) is executed. If no match is found nothing will be executed. You can also add a default case to switch which will be executed if no other matches are found. The syntax of the switch is 
Here the value of the expression is compared against the values in each case. Once a match is found the statements associated with that case is executed. If no match is found the statements under the default section is executed. 
Execute the below program 
You will get the output as 
Change the value of a and b to 3 and the result will be 
You can also have multiple values in a case by separating them with a comma.
Array represents a fixed size, named sequence of elements of the same type. You cannot have an array which contains both integer and characters in it. You cannot change the size of an array once You define the size.
The syntax for declaring an array is
Each array element can be assigned value using the syntax
Array index starts from 0 to size-1.
You can assign values to array elements during declaration using the syntax
You can also ignore the size parameter while declaring the array with values by replacing size with … and the compiler will find the length from the number of values. Syntax is
You can find the length of the array by using the syntax
Execute the below Go example to understand the array 
Output
A slice is a portion or segment of an array. Or it is a view or partial view of an underlying array to which it points. You can access the elements of a slice using the slice name and index number just as you do in an array. You cannot change the length of an array, but you can change the size of a slice.
Contents of a slice are actually the pointers to the elements of an array. It means if you change any element in a slice, the underlying array contents also will be affected.
The syntax for creating a slice is 
This will create a slice named slice_name from an array named array_name with the elements at the index start to end-1.
Now in this Golang tutorial, we will execute the below program. The program will create a slice from the array and print it. Also, you can see that modifying the contents in the slice will modify the actual array.
This will print result as
There are certain functions like Golang len, Golang append which you can apply on slices
len(slice_name) – returns the length of the slice
append(slice_name, value_1, value_2) – Golang append is used to append value_1 and value_2 to an existing slice.
append(slice_nale1,slice_name2…) – appends slice_name2 to slice_name1
Execute the following program.
The output will be
The program first creates 2 slices and printed its length. Then it appended one slice to other and then appended a string to the resulting slice.
A function represents a block of statements which performs a specific task. A function declaration tells us function name, return type and input parameters. Function definition represents the code contained in the function. The syntax for declaring the function is 
The parameters and return types are optional. Also, you can return multiple values from a function.
Now in this Golang tutorial, let’s run the following Golang example. Here function named calc will accept 2 numbers and performs the addition and subtraction and returns both values.
The output will be
Packages are used to organize the code. In a big project, it is not feasible to write code in a single file. Go programming language allow us to organize the code under different packages. This increases code readability and reusability. An executable Go program should contain a package named main and the program execution starts from the function named main. You can import other packages in our program using the syntax
We will see and discuss in this Golang tutorial, how to create and use packages in the following Golang example.
Step 1) Create a file called package_example.go and add the below code
In the above program fmt is a package which Go programming language provides us mainly for I/O purposes. Also, you can see a package named calculation. Inside the main() you can see a step sum := calculation.Do_add(x,y). It means you are invoking the function Do_add from package calculation.
Step 2)			First, you should create the package calculation inside a folder with the same name under src folder of the go. The installed path of go can be found from the PATH variable. 
For mac, find the path by executing echo $PATH		
<img decoding="async" width="820" height="62" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi9.png" alt="">		
So the path is /usr/local/go
For windows, find the path by executing echo %GOROOT%			
<img decoding="async" width="850" height="103" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi11.png" alt="">		
Here the path is C:\Go\
Step 3)  Navigate to to the src folder(/usr/local/go/src for mac  and C:\Go\src for windows). Now from the code, the package name is calculation. Go requires the package should be placed in a directory of the same name under src directory. Create a directory named calculation in src folder.
Step 4) Create a file called calc.go (You can give any name, but the package name in the code matters. Here it should be calculation) inside calculation directory and add the below code
Step 5) Run the command go install from the calculation directory which will compile the calc.go.
<img decoding="async" width="932" height="276" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi12.png" alt="">		
Step 6) Now go back to package_example.go and run go run package_example.go. The output will be Sum 25.		
Note that the name of the function Do_add starts with a capital letter. This is because in Go if the function name starts with a capital letter it means other programs can see(access) it else other programs cannot access it. If the function name was do_add , then You would have got the error
cannot refer to unexported name calculation.calc..
Defer statements are used to defer the execution of a function call until the function that contains the defer statement completes execution.
Lets learn this with an example: 
The output will be
Here execution of sample() is deferred until the execution of the enclosing function(main()) completes.
Stacking defer is using multiple defer statements. Suppose you have multiple defer statements inside a function. Go places all the deferred function calls in a stack, and once the enclosing function returns, the stacked functions are executed in the Last In First Out(LIFO) order. You can see this in the below example. 
Execute the below code
The output will be
Here the code inside the main() executes first, and then the deferred function calls are executed in the reverse order, i.e. 4, 3,2,1.
Before explaining pointers let’s will first discuss ‘&’ operator. The ‘&’ operator is used to get the address of a variable. It means ‘&a’ will print the memory address of variable a.
In this Golang tutorial, we will execute the below program to display the value of a variable and the address of that variable
The result will be
A pointer variable stores the memory address of another variable. You can define a pointer using the syntax
The asterisk(*) represents the variable is a pointer. You will understand more by executing the below program
The output will be
A Structure is a user defined datatype which itself contains one more element of the same or different type. 
Using a structure is a 2 step process. 
First, create(declare) a structure type 
Second, create variables of that type to store values.
Structures are mainly used when you want to store related data together. 
Consider a piece of employee information which has name, age, and address. You can handle this in 2 ways
Create 3 arrays – one array stores the names of employees, one stores age and the third one stores age. 
Declare a structure type with 3 fields- name, address, and age. Create an array of that structure type where each element is a structure object having name, address, and age.
The first approach is not efficient. In these kinds of scenarios, structures are more convenient.
The syntax for declaring a structure is
An example of a structure declaration is 
Here a new user defined type named emp is created. Now, you can create variables of the type emp using the syntax
An example is
You can set values for the empdata1 as
You can also create a structure variable and assign values by
Here, you need to maintain the order of elements. Raj will be mapped to name, next element to address and the last one to age.
Execute the code below
Output
A method is a function with a receiver argument. Architecturally, it’s between the func keyword and method name. The syntax of a method is 
Let’s convert the above example program to use methods instead of function.
Go is not an object oriented language and it doesn’t have the concept of class. Methods give a feel of what you do in object oriented programs where the functions of a class are invoked using the syntax objectname.functionname()
Go supports concurrent execution of tasks. It means Go can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. It is different from the concept of parallelism. In parallelism, a task is split into small subtasks and are executed in parallel. But in concurrency, multiple tasks are being executed simultaneously. Concurrency is achieved in Go using Goroutines and Channels.
A goroutine is a function which can run concurrently with other functions. Usually when a function is invoked the control gets transferred into the called function, and once its completed execution control returns to the calling function. The calling function then continues its execution. The calling function waits for the invoked function to complete the execution before it proceeds with the rest of the statements.
But in the case of goroutine, the calling function will not wait for the execution of the invoked function to complete. It will continue to execute with the next statements. You can have multiple goroutines in a program.
Also, the main program will exit once it completes executing its statements and it will not wait for completion of the goroutines invoked. 
Goroutine is invoked using keyword go followed by a function call.
Example
You will understand goroutines with the below Golang examples. Execute the below program
The output will be
Here the main program completed execution even before the goroutine started. The display() is a goroutine which is invoked using the syntax
In the above code, the main() doesn’t wait for the display() to complete, and the main() completed its execution before the display() executed its code. So the print statement inside display() didn’t get printed.
Now we modify the program to print the statements from display() as well. We add a time delay of 2 sec in the for loop of main() and a 1 sec delay in the for loop of the display().
The output will be somewhat similar to 
Here You can see both loops are being executed in an overlapping fashion because of the concurrent execution.
Channels are a way for functions to communicate with each other. It can be thought as a medium to where one routine places data and is accessed by another routine in Golang server.
A channel can be declared with the syntax
Example:
You can send data to a channel using the syntax
Example
You can receive data from a channel using the syntax
Example
In the above Go language examples of goroutine, you have seen the main program doesn’t wait for the goroutine. But that is not the case when channels are involved. Suppose if a goroutine pushes data to channel, the main() will wait on the statement receiving channel data until it gets the data. 
You will see this in below Go language examples. First, write a normal goroutine and see the behaviour. Then modify the program to use channels and see the behaviour.
Execute the below program
The output will be 
The main() finished the execution and did exit before the goroutine executes. So the print inside the display() didn’t get executed. 
Now modify the above program to use channels and see the behaviour.
The output will be
Here what happens is the main() on reaching x := <-ch will wait for data on channel ch. The display() has a wait of 5 seconds and then push data to the channel ch. The main() on receiving the data from the channel gets unblocked and continues its execution.
The sender who pushes data to channel can inform the receivers that no more data will be added to the channel by closing the channel. This is mainly used when you use a loop to push data to a channel. A channel can be closed using
And at the receiver end, it is possible to check whether the channel is closed using an additional variable while fetching data from channel using
If the status is True it means you received data from the channel. If false, it means you are trying to read from a closed channel
You can also use channels for communication between goroutines. Need to use 2 goroutines – one pushes data to the channel and other receives the data from the channel. See the below program
Here there are 2 subroutines one pushes data to the channel and other prints data to the channel. The function add_to_channel adds the numbers from 0 to 9 and closes the channel. Simultaneously the function fetch_from_channel waits at
x, flag := <- ch and once the data become available, it prints the data. It exits once the flag is false which means the channel is closed.
The wait in the main() is given to prevent the exiting of main() until the goroutines finish the execution.
Execute the code and see the output as
Select can be viewed as a switch statement which works on channels. Here the case statements will be a channel operation.  Usually, each case statements will be read attempt from the channel. When any of the cases is ready(the channel is read), then the statement associated with that case is executed. If multiple cases are ready, it will choose a random one. You can have a default case which is executed if none of the cases is ready.
Let’s see the below code
Executing the above program will give the output:
Here the select statement waits for data to be available in any of the channels. The data2() adds data to the channel after a sleep of 2 seconds which will cause the second case to execute.
Add a default case to the select in the same program and see the output. Here, on reaching select block, if no case is having data ready on the channel, it will execute the default block without waiting for data to be available on any channel.
This program will give the output:
This is because when the select block reached, no channel had data for reading. So, the default case is executed.
Mutex is the short form for mutual exclusion. Mutex is used when you don’t want to allow a resource to be accessed by multiple subroutines at the same time. Mutex has 2 methods – Lock and Unlock. Mutex is contained in sync package. So, you have to import the sync package. The statements which have to be mutually exclusively executed can be placed inside mutex.Lock() and mutex.Unlock().
Let’s learn mutex with an example which is counting the number of times a loop is executed. In this program we expect routine to run loop 10 times and the count is stored in sum. You call this routine 3 times so the total count should be 30. The count is stored in a global variable count.
First, You run the program without mutex
See the result
The result could be different when you execute it but the final result won’t be 30.
Here what happens is 3 goroutines are trying to increase the loop count stored in the variable count. Suppose at a moment count is 5 and goroutine1 is going to increment the count to 6. The main steps include
Copy count to temp
Increment temp
Store temp back to count
Suppose soon after performing step 3 by goroutine1; another goroutine might have an old value say 3 does the above steps and store 4 back, which is wrong. This can be prevented by using mutex which causes other routines to wait when one routine is already using the variable.
Now You will run the program with mutex. Here the above mentioned 3 steps are executed in a mutex.
Now the output will be
Here we get the expected result as final output. Because the statements reading, incrementing and writing back of count is executed in a mutex.
Errors are abnormal conditions like closing a file which is not opened, open a file which doesn’t exist, etc. Functions usually return errors as the last return value.
The below example explains more about the error.
The output will be:
Here we tried to open a non-existing file, and it returned the error to er variable. If the file is valid, then the error will be null
Using this feature, you can create  custom errors. This is done by using New() of error package. We will rewrite the above program to make use of custom errors.
Run the below program
The output will be:
Here the area() returns the area of a square. If the input is less than 1 then area() returns an error message.
Files are used to store data. Go allows us to read data from the files
First create a file, data.txt, in your present directory with the below content.
Now run the below program to see it prints the contents of the entire file as output
Here the data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(“data.txt”) reads the data and returns a byte sequence. While printing it is converted to string format. 			
You will see this with a program
Here a file is created, test.txt. If the file already exists then the contents of the file are truncated. Writeline() is used to write the contents to the file. After that, You closed the file using Close(). 		
In this Go tutorial, we covered,

Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or people called “things” that are embedded with software, electronics, network, and sensors that allows these objects to collect and exchange data. The goal of IoT is to extend to internet connectivity from standard devices like computer, mobile, tablet to relatively dumb devices like a toaster.
IoT makes virtually everything “smart,” by improving aspects of our life with the power of data collection, AI algorithm, and networks. The thing in IoT can also be a person with a diabetes monitor implant, an animal with tracking devices, etc. This IoT tutorial for beginners covers all the Basics of IoT.
The entire IoT process starts with the devices themselves like smartphones, smartwatches, electronic appliances like TV, Washing Machine which helps you to communicate with the IoT platform.
Now in this IoT tutorial, we will learn about four fundamental components of an IoT system:
1) Sensors/Devices:  Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. All this data may have various levels of complexities. It could be a simple temperature monitoring sensor, or it may be in the form of the video feed.
A device may have various types of sensors which performs multiple tasks apart from sensing. Example, A mobile phone is a device which has multiple sensors like GPS, camera but your smartphone is not able to sense these things.
2) Connectivity:  All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communications. These communication mediums include mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc.
3) Data Processing: Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data. This process can be just checking the temperature, reading on devices like AC or heaters. However, it can sometimes also be very complex like identifying objects, using computer vision on video.
4)User Interface:  The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notification through email or text message.  The user sometimes might need an interface which actively checks their IoT system. For example, the user has a camera installed in his home. He wants to access video recording and all the feeds with the help of a web server.
However, it’s not always one-way communication. Depending on the IoT application and complexity of the system, the user may also be able to perform an action which may create cascading effects.
For example, if a user detects any changes in the temperature of the refrigerator, with the help of IoT technology the user should able to adjust the temperature with the help of their mobile phone.

33 Hard Drive Tested
250+ Hours of Research
1.5k+ Reviews Examined
Unbiased Reviews
When people talk about the essentials for the perfect gaming experience, many of them forget to mention one important piece. The hard drive. You might have the best gaming monitor, a special mouse, and keyboard, a gaming pad maybe or even a gaming chair but these will mean nothing when you have no space to install your games.
Which is why you need a dedicated gaming hardware. Not only does it allow you enough space for storing your favorite games but are also optimized to reduce the load time and minimize game lagging. Moreover, with over 100 different types of best gaming hard drives available, you will find our list of the top 7 best gaming hard disks pretty useful.



Sometimes we just want to add extra storage to our devices without having to replace the existing hard drive. If you are using a desktop PC, this may not be a problem since they usually allow space for additional hard drives, but it’s different with a laptop.
Storage Capacity: 1TB to 8TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 256MB
Warranty: 2 Years
Seagate External hard drive is ideal for laptop gamers. These are available in sizes starting from 1TB up to 8TB, and all you have to do is connect them to a power outlet then to your computer using the 3.0 or 2.O USB ports. However, if you are using a Mac, you will need to reformat them in order to be fully compatible.
If you are a game hoarder like me, then you will appreciate the value this expansion hard disk brings. I really find it hard to delete games even when it’s necessary, but with an extra 4TB I can keep my collection of games and check them out whenever I am not in the mood for playing the usual.
Western Digital is one of the leading brands in the manufacture of hard disks and you can, therefore, expect superior products from them. The WD Black series is one such example we highly recommend as an upgrade for your laptop hard disk.
Storage Capacity: 250GB to 8TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 32MB
Warranty: 5 Years
You can choose from its several capacities starting from 250GB to 8TB, but for this review, we will look at the WD Black 2TB. Why? It offers sufficient space for all your game’s downloadable content (DLC), it’s quite affordable, and most importantly, it excels in performance levels. Now, nothing is stopping you from getting the new Fortnite Founder’s pack.
Equipped with a dual-core processor, you can expect excellent load times with read/write speed of almost 200mbps. It also features 64MB of cache which is also crucial in boosting the load and access time. To top it off it comes with the industry’s best rotation speed of 7200RPS.
It also features various protection mechanisms like No Touch Ramp Load technology and Corruption Protection Technology that are meant to safeguard your data better. Physically this hard disk also includes a layer of silica gel on top of the plastic wrapper to ensure better protection against moisture.
Seagate came up with the FireCuda hard disk series to specifically cater for the gamers, and hence all of its features are meant to improve your gaming experience. Which is why it is only available in 1TB and 2TB version since any lesser capacity is not really ideal in this modern gaming era.
Storage Capacity: 1TB & 2TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
The FireCuda 3.5″ SSHD is the bigger desktop version of the Seagate FireCuda 2.5″ SSHD and comes with 7200RPM, 64MB of cache and a SATA 6Gb/s connection. However, the highlight of this Hard disk is its Hybrid architecture.
It is the perfect fusion between an SSD and an HDD. That is it combines the speed of an SSD and the storage capabilities of the HDD. By using adaptive learning, the FireCuda can memorize the frequently accessed games and save them in the flash memory. This significantly reduces the access time to these games.
Comparatively, this hard disk produces high performance than the 2.5” FireCuda, but this can be attributed to its larger size which allows more space for the rotating disks.
Other mentionable features include the Instant Secure Erase to safely and easily delete content from the hard drive. The Self-Encrypting technology protects your data. You also get a 2-year warranty.
Until recently, the biggest storage space you could get on the Xbox is 500GB. Even now you will have to cough up more bucks to get the 1TB SSD. But do you know what’s better than the wd blue 1TB SSD from Microsoft? The Seagate 4TB hard drive specifically made for the Xbox.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 4TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 128MB
Warranty: 2 Years
This self-powered hard disk may be a bit bigger than its 2TB counterpart, but it is still pretty convenient to carry around. It features USB 3.0 ports which means data transfer is quite fast. It only takes a few minutes to copy Halo 5 which is more than 50GB in size.
Another thing we found pretty convenient is the Plug and Play setup which means once the Xbox recognizes the hard disk it only takes some seconds to load the game. You will also find that it takes less time to load your game’s DLC than with the internal hard drive.
Additionally, you can use the drive to save movies and other media files that can be played through your Xbox console. This hard drive comes with a 2-year warranty.
The Samsung 860 Evo follows up on the success of its predecessor, the 850 Evo, and having inherited everything we liked on the 850 EVO it’s easy to understand why we recommend this SSD storage device.
Storage Capacity: 250GB to 4TB
Seq.Read/Write Speed: 550/520MB/s
Cache: 512MB LPDDR4 (250/500GB)
Warranty: 5 Years
However, it is the incredible speed of the SSD that will really appeal to you as a gamer. Although this is typical of all SSDs, Samsung takes it a notch higher with their latest V-NAND technology that can sequentially read at speeds of 550MB/s and write at about 520MB/s. This is more than 2x the standard HDD.
This hard drive has also seen a 51% increase in performance from the 850 EVO with 6x more endurance. Also, unlike some other drives relying on software-based encryption, the Samsung 860 EVO comes with the Self Encrypting Drive technology that ensures that your data is safe without affecting the hard disk performance.
Now, we can all agree that upgrading to a new hard drive can be a hassle especially considering you have to reinstall the OS then move all your old files to the new drive. But now thanks to the Samsung Data Migration software, this process has been really streamlined.
You also have the option to download the Samsung Magician software that will help you monitor and maintain the SSD. This drive comes with a 5-year warranty and is available in sizes ranging from 250GB to 4TB.
I have mentioned that gaming hard drives should be large in size, but that does not automatically rule out the smaller drives. Especially if you have a tight budget or if your game library is not insanely big.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 6 TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
The WD Blue hard drive is one of the best budget hard drives you can buy for gaming. With a rotation speed of 7200RPM and a cache size of 8MB, this drive will still be able to provide a decent load and access time.
Of course, you will have to compromise on the number and size of the games you play, but considering the price I would say you will be getting the best value for your money. On top of getting a 2-year warranty from the reseller, you also have the option to return the product for a full refund.
Don’t you hate it when you have to wait for what seems like forever for your game to load? Well, with a 64 MB cache size and 7200RPM you will definitely notice faster load time. With 2TB of storage space, it’s hard to envision you having any trouble with inadequate space even after installing all the available mods for your games.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 3TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
Toshiba has also included a caching technology that efficiently allocates the cache space during read and write cycles resulting in faster access to your games. They have also taken the necessary measures to protect your data which is evident through the internal shock sensors that absorb any impacts resulting from falls or knocks and the secured motor shaft that protects the hard drive against system vibrations.
The No-Touch Ramp-load tech also helps to reduce the wearing down of the recording head by ensuring that it does not touch the disk surface. This series of Toshiba hard disks are available in sizes ranging from 500GB-3TB and comes with a 2-year standard limited Warranty.
So, we just gave you the best hard drives but how do you really end up concluding that this is the most suited drive for your gaming needs? Follow along as we tell you everything you need to know before purchasing as your pc gaming hard drive. We will begin by answering the one question that no one seems to agree on.
Well, no one can argue that SSD is considerably faster than the HDD. This is because unlike the HDD which stores data by manipulating magnetic fields created by spinning metal plates, the SSD uses flash memory similar to that of a USB flash drive which is much faster to read and write on.
The HDD, on the other hand, is considered to be more long-lasting and is without doubt, cheaper than SSD per Gigabyte. You will be surprised to learn that it might cost you more to purchase a 500GB SSD than it would if you are buying a 4TB HDD.
So, to answer the question, I will say that it depends on what you are really after. Personally, I recommend the HDD since as much as it is slower than the SSD, it’s not extremely slow, and it’s something you can easily compromise especially considering the amount of money you will be saving. You can check out the detailed comparison of SSDs vs. HDDs here
While buying Gaming HDD, you should consider the following factors:  
Here are more details:
To avoid disappointments after buying the hard disk, you need to ask yourself some few questions and also familiarize yourself with some of the important features of the hard drives. This way you have a better understanding of what you are really getting. Which are these factors?
source
The main advantage of the external hard disks is their portability. Which also makes them perfect backups in case your PC is compromised. Desktop PCs allow you room to add extra hard disks, but if you are using a laptop or other gaming device, you will have to replace your existing hard drive.
I am assuming the main reason you are buying the hard disk is so that you eliminate the need to have to delete some files when you want to install a new game or add modifications. Also, at a time when a single game can take up to 100GB, Call of Duty WWII is 90GB; it only makes sense that you select the hard disk that will allow you sufficient storage.
The hard drives store information on spinning magnetic plates. Right? Now, the faster these plates spin then, the faster the load and access time. The rotation is measured in RPM (Rotations per Minute), and although we recommend hard disks with 7200RPM, you can still make do with 5400RPM.
This functions very much like Computer RAM Memory by storing important files temporarily so that it takes less time to access this data on the disk.
Generally, the larger the Cache size, the faster the hard disk will be. However, the difference is not major, and as such, this should not be the biggest determiner.
With so many hard disk brands, it’s comforting to know that your hard disk is from a trusted brand that has been tested and proven not to disappoint. For instance, you will notice that our list has been dominated by certain brands. Of course, there is no guarantee that a hard disk will not die on you but it’s better safe than sorry.

ITIL is a set of well-defined guidelines that helps Software professionals to deliver the best IT services. ITIL guidelines are the best practices that are observed, gathered, and put together over time for delivering quality IT services. The full form of ITIL is Information Technology Infrastructure Library.
Popular IT services covered by ITIL are Cloud services, backup, network security, Data processing and storage, managed print services, IT consulting, Help desk support, IOT etc.
The systematic and structured approach of ITIL framework  helps an organization in managing risk, establishing cost-effective practices, strengthening customer relations. All these eventually result in building a stable IT environment for your business.
Here are some important reasons for using the ITIL method in business.
Here in this ITIL Tutorial, we will see some important landmarks from the history of ITIL:
Now in this ITIL Tutorial, we will learn some important terminologies and definitions used in ITIL:
Here are some important features of ITIL
The ITIL Framework process contains the following stages: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transitions, Service Operations and Continual Service Improvement.
The following figure shows important ITIL Framework stages:
Service Strategy Operations ensure that services such as fulfilling user requests, working on service failures, fixing problems and carrying out routine operational tasks efficiently and effectively.
Here, are important services comes under this stage:
The Financial Management services provides a means of understanding and controlling costs and opportunities associated with services.
Service Portfolio Management helps you to organizes the process by which services are identified, evaluated, selected, and chartered.
The Demand Management is concerned with understanding and influencing customer demand. It also involves User Profiles, which characterize various groups of users for a given service.
This stage ensures agreed service are delivered when, where, and at the defined cost.
Here, are important services comes under this stage:
Service Level Management is deals with securing and managing agreements between customers and the service provider irrespective of the level of performance and reliability associated with specific services.
Here, are important services comes under this stage:
Availability Management service is concerned with the agreed-upon availability requirements as established in Service Level Agreements (SLA).
Capacity Management is focused with ensuring that at all times, the cost-effective capacity exists that meets or exceeds the demands of the business as established in Service Level Agreements
IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) process ensures that the service provider provides the minimum agreed-upon levels of service. It uses techniques like Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Management of Risk (MOR).
The Service Catalog is a subset which contains services available to customers and users.
The goal of the Service Transition process is to build and deploy IT services. It also make sure that changes to services and Service Management ITIL processes are conducted in a coordinated way.
Change management activity controls the lifecycle of all the changes with minimum disruption to IT services.
The goal of this service is to maintain information about configuration items needed to deliver an IT service, including their relationships.
This process helps you to plan, schedule, and control the movement of releases to conduct testing to live environments. It also ensures that the integrity of the live environment is protected and the correct components are released.
This ITIL process mainly focuses on planning and coordinating the use of resources to deploy a major release within the expected cost, time and quality.
This process helps to deployed releases and the resulting services able to meet  expectations of the customer.
Evaluation process helps you to assess major changes, like the introduction of a new service or a significant change to an existing service
The objective of knowledge management service is to gather, analyze, store, and share knowledge and information within an organization. It helps improving efficiency by reducing the need to rediscover knowledge.
This ITIL stage focuses on meeting end-users’ expectations while balancing costs and discovering any potential problems.
It is the main point of contact between users and the service provider. A service desk handles communication with the users and also manages incidents and service requests.
The objective of Incident Management is to manage the lifecycle of all incidents.  It also makes sure that services are returning back to the IT service to users as fast as possible.
The objective of problem management is to manage the lifecycle of all problems. It helps IT organization to prevent incidents from happening and minimize the impact of incidents which cannot be prevented.
The object of event management is to make sure configuration items and services are continually monitored and to filter and categorize events to determine the specific actions.
The objective of request management is to fulfil service requests. In many cases, they are minor changes (for example, requests for changing a password).
This function offers technical expertise and support for the management of the IT infrastructure.
Application Management is a service that is responsible for managing applications throughout their lifecycle.
The goal is to maintain information about configuration items needed to deliver an IT service operations, including their relationships.
It makes sure that IT services can recover and continue from a service incident. It helps to conduct business simper analysis to prioritize business recovery.
Here are the major differences between ITIL v2. And ITIL v3.
Here, are pros/benefits of using ITIL services

Before we start learning Salesforce tutorial, lets understand-
Cloud computing is all about using a remote server, to store, manage, and process data, instead of a local server/ personal computer.
CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a kind of software that stores customer contact information like name, address, age, phone number. It also keeps tracks of customer activity like website visits, numbers of outgoing and incoming phone calls, email, and more.
Salesforce is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for managing customer relationships and integration with other systems. This SaaS tool helps to create custom solutions for marketing, sales, services and ecommerce as per business requirements. Salesforce has now expanded from just CRM to offer multiple products.
Here, are prime reasons for using Salesforce CRM:
The below figure demonstrates detailed Salesforce Architecture:
The architecture of Salesforce can be divided into various components described as follows:

The organization of a COBOL program is hierarchical. It’s not necessarily needed for all of the components to be present for the hierarchical relationship to exist.
Here, are various components of the COBOL program:
A division is a block of code, which usually contains one or more sections. It starts where the division name is encountered. It ends with the beginning of the next division.
Sections are the logical subdivision of the program logic. It is the collection of paragraphs.
Paragraphs are the portion of a selection which is a user-defined or predefined name which should be followed by a period. This section includes zero or more sentences.
Sentences are a combination of single or multiple statements. They should occur only in the procedure division. A sentence in COBOL language must end with a period(.).
These are the meaningful COBOL statements which perform some processing.
These are the lowest in the hierarchy which cannot be divided.
Various divisions in COBOL program structure are as follows:
It helps you to identify input and output files to the program.

Here, are some  most important coding rules while working with COBOL:
Here, some important syntax rules of COBOL:
In COBOL variable		is a named location in memory into which a program can put data and from which it can retrieve data. A data-name or identity. It is the name used to identify the area of memory that is reserved for the variable.
Variables must be described in terms of their size and type. Every variable used in a COBOL program should have encryption in the DATA DIVISION.
In COBOL, If else statement is used for conditional branching
The relational operators and some spelled out phrases can be used
If x < y – this can be written as if x is less than y
<, >, =,>=,<= are the available relational operators
NOT, AND, OR are logical operators used in COBOL
Greater than, less than, equal to are the spelled out phrases
To check an alpha number variable for what type of data it holds, we can use if x is number, if x is alphabetic, conditions. It is based on T or F value.
You can use if-then-else if for multi-level conditions
If no condition is matched, then the other clause is executed. This is quite similar to the switch statements in other languages.

Apache Hive helps with querying and managing large datasets real fast. It is an ETL tool for the Hadoop ecosystem. In this Apache Hive tutorial for beginners, you will learn Hive basics and important topics like HQL queries, data extractions, partitions, buckets, and so on. This Hive tutorials series will help you learn Hive concepts and basics.
To learn this Hive query tutorial, you need basic knowledge of  SQL, Hadoop and knowledge of other databases will be of an additional help.
Hive evolved as a data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop Map-Reduce framework.
The size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is growing and in a way, it is making traditional data warehousing solutions more expensive. Hadoop with MapReduce framework, is being used as an alternative solution for analyzing data sets with huge size. Though, Hadoop has proved useful for working on huge data sets, its MapReduce framework is very low level and it requires programmers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. Hive comes here for rescue of programmers.


Hive comes with a command-line shell interface which can be used to create tables and execute queries.
Hive query language is similar to SQL wherein it supports subqueries. With Hive query language, it is possible to take a MapReduce joins across Hive tables. It has a support for simple SQL like functions– CONCAT, SUBSTR, ROUND etc., and aggregation functions– SUM, COUNT, MAX etc. It also supports GROUP BY and SORT BY clauses. It is also possible to write user defined functions in Hive query language.
Apache Hive is a data warehouse framework for querying and analysis of data stored in HDFS. It is developed on top of Hadoop. Hive is an open-source software to analyze large data sets on Hadoop. It provides SQL-like declarative language, called HiveQL, to express queries. Using Hive-QL, users associated with  SQL can perform data analysis very easily.
Prior to choosing one of these two options, we must look at some of their features.
While choosing between Hive and Map reduce following factors are taken in consideration;

An organization needs to work with data which comes from different sources which can be in various file formats. The data should be extracted from a different source which can be from different servers or databases. This data is integrated into one standard format in a common staging area.
In this stage, the integrated data is still not prepared for visualization as the data needs processing. This data is pre-processed. For example, redundant values, missing values will be removed from the data set.
The business rule should be applied to the data when the data is cleaned. You can load that data back to Data Warehouse.
Once the data is loaded and processed, it can be visualized much better with use of various visualization that Power Bi has to offer. Use of dashboard and report helps one represent data more intuitively. This visual report helps business end users to take business decision based on the insights.

There are Power BI components are 5 main components released in the market.
DAX is a formula expression language which is called (DAX) which can be used with various visualization tools like Power BI. It is also known as a functional language, where the full code is kept inside a function. DAX programming formulas contain two data types: Numeric and  Other.
Each is linked to the other by having common columns. Here is a simple diagram of Power BI Dashboard Example showing the relationships.
<img decoding="async" width="634" height="554" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/061419_0656_PowerBITuto10.png" alt="Dax Function">
There are 3 things in Power BI where you can use
DAX –
Let’s see all these Power BI examples and see how DAX functions works.
Calculated column allows you to create new columns based on the given data.
For example, there is no ‘ Final price’ column available in the  Items table.  Here, the DAX function is used to calculate a new column when only total price & quantity are available.
Price = List_Items[MRP]*List_Items[Qty]			
In the data shown in above Power BI example, each row will now have the respective calculated price.
You can perform a calculation using measure without the need to add any data as shown in the below Power BI example. This is very helpful for reports where the price can be displayed, without requiring an entirely new column to store it.
Example:
1] Total of the MRP column * Total of Qty column						
DAX functions in tabular model return entire tables. For example, In order to generate a list of all the country the organization has clients in, use the function:
cities touched = DISTINCT(Customers[City])			
Filters hide rows that don’t fit given criteria. A calculation after filtering out data will be applicable only on a row which matches those criteria.
Some Important DAX functions are:
This DAX function allows you to find the average from a given set of values as shown in the below Power BI example.
Example –
AvgComm = AVERAGE(List_Items[Price])	
Helps you to find the maximum from a given set of values.
Example – Find out the highest order.
HighSale = MAX(List_Items[Price])			
Helps you to find the minimum set of values.
Example –  Allows you to find out the lowest order.
LowestSale = MIN(List_Items[Price])			
Count any umerical data.
Example – Count number of ticket issued.
TicketVolume = COUNT(Invoices[Ticket])			
This function helps you to join values in calculated columns. You can use ConcatenateX if using in measures.
Example – Concatenate the Item names, and MRPs will give a unique code for all the price points at which each product is sold.
ProMrp = CONCATENATE(List_Items[Item],List_Items[MRP])			
The function allows you to calculate the sum from the start of the current Year to the specified date. It performs calculate base on a calendar year, not a financial year.
Example – Calculate Sales totals for the price column.
CumiSales = TOTALYTD(SUM(List_Items[Price]),Invoices[Date])				
Returns everything. Ignores filters.
Example – Used with the calculate function above.

Now in this QlikView tutorials guide, we will learn about QlikView History:
Now in this QlikView for dummies tutorial, we will learn about the architecture of QlikView:
The Qlik view architecture comprises of three main components, namely
All these components collectively help in designing, developing, and implement the QlikView application.
Let’s learn all these components in detail:
The QlikView Desktop is a Windows-based development tool. It is used by developers to use to create QlikView data model and GUI layout for application to use at frontend.
The developer prepares data for user to use in the desktop environment. They manipulate the data set using SQL like scripting.
Developers using code script, linkages/association between data fields and value can be established. The data can also be transformed. The files prepared using the Qlick view desktop can be used and shared in another QlikView application.
Applications created in the desktop version are hosted on Qlik View Server (QVS) so that user can access and use them anywhere. A QlikView server maintains communication between client/end users.
Qlikview server is supported by a powerful QLX engine which provides efficient in-memory data analysis, Data management, distribution, consolidation, scaling, and data access. It is the QVS server which provides data file from the backend to frontend users.
The QlikView Publisher is an optional mobile for the QlikView server-side component. This component allows you to fetch data from a data source like standard data files, Salesforce, and load data directly into QlikView files.
It allows you to conduct data distribution through scheduling and administering tasks. Qlik View Publisher also helps you to reduce unnecessary data load and traffic by efficient distribution.
Qlick view management console is a  platform that centrally manages all the other QlikView components. It is a web-based interface and a server-side app controlled by IT professionals.
QlikView User Access allows customers to access and manipulate data files. The access points for the user are mostly web browsers which can open using desktop, mobile, laptops, etc.
Therefore, when the user opens a document in Qlickview and requests to load a data file, the file fetch by the service from the backend is always in the original format. However, the QlikView document made using that file is still in .qvw extension.

A distributed application is an application which can run on multiple systems in a network. It runs simultaneously by coordinating themselves to complete a certain task. These tasks may take plenty of hours to complete by any non-distributed application.
Apache Zookeeper is an open source distributed coordination service that helps to manage a large set of hosts. Management and coordination in a distributed environment is tricky. Zookeeper automates this process and allows developers to focus on building software features rather than worry about it’s distributed nature.
Zookeeper helps you to maintain configuration information, naming, group services for distributed applications. It implements different protocols on the cluster so that the application should not implement on their own. It provides a single coherent view of multiple machines.
Here, are important reasons behind the popularity of the Zookeeper:
Here is a brief explanation about Apache Zookeeper architecture:
Server: The server sends an acknowledge when any client connects. In the case when there is no response from the connected server, the client automatically redirects the message to another server.
Client: Client is one of the nodes in the distributed application cluster. It helps you to accesses information from the server. Every client sends a message to the server at regular intervals that helps the server to know that the client is alive.
Leader: One of the servers is designated a Leader. It gives all the information to the clients as well as an acknowledgment that the server is alive. It would performs automatic recovery if any of the connected nodes failed.
Follower: Server node which follows leader instruction is called a follower.
Ensemble/Cluster: Group of Zookeeper servers which is called ensemble or a Cluster. You can use ZooKeeper infrastructure in the cluster mode to have the system at the optimal value when you are running the Apache.
ZooKeeper WebUI: If you want to work with ZooKeeper resource management, then you need to use WebUI. It allows working with ZooKeeper using the web user interface, instead of using the command line. It offers fast and effective communication with the ZooKeeper application.
Now in this ZooKeeper tutorial, let’s learn about Zookeeper Data Model. The Below figure explains Apache Zookeeper Data Model:
There are three types of Znodes:
Persistence znode: This type of znode is alive even after the client which created that specific znode, is disconnected. By default, in zookeeper, all nodes are persistent if it is not specified.
Ephemeral znode: This type of zookeeper znode are alive until the client is alive. Therefore, when the client gets a disconnect from the zookeeper, it will also be deleted. Moreover, ephemeral nodes are not allowed to have children.
Sequential znode: Sequential znodes can be either ephemeral or persistent. So when a new znode is created as a sequential znode. You can assign the path of the znode by attaching a 10 digit sequence number to the original name.
Zookeeper, a watch event is a one-time trigger which is sent to the client that set watch. It occurred when data from that watch changes. ZDM watch allows clients to get notifications when znode changes. ZDM read operations like getData(), getChidleren(), exist have the option of setting a watch.
Watches are ordered, the order of watch events corresponds to the order of the updates. A client will able to see a watch event for znode before seeing the new data which corresponds to that znode.
Zookeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes. ACL is made up of a pair of (Scheme: id, permission)
Build in ACL schemes:
world: has a single id, anyone
auth: Not use any id, It represents any authenticated user
digest: use a username: password
host: Allows you to use client’s hostname as ACL id identity
IP: use the client host IP address as ACL id identity
ACL Permissions:

Hbase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). In this HBase tutorial for beginners, you will learn Apache HBase basics and advanced concepts. This HBase course contains all the HBase basics from introduction, installation, architecture to advanced stuff.
HBase is an open-source, column-oriented distributed database system in a Hadoop environment. Initially, it was Google Big Table, afterward; it was renamed as HBase and is primarily written in Java.  Apache HBase is needed for real-time Big Data applications.
HBase can store massive amounts of data from terabytes to petabytes. The tables present in HBase consist of billions of rows having millions of columns. HBase is built for low latency operations, which is having some specific features compared to traditional relational models.
Here is what we cover in this Apache HBase Training Guide


In this HBase tutorial for beginners, you will learn What Apache HBase is, the Architecture of HBase, How to install HBase, Steps to create a table in HBase, HBase Advantage and Limitations, etc.
A table for a popular web application may consist of billions of rows. If we want to search a particular row from such a huge amount of data, HBase is the ideal choice as query fetch time is less. Most of the online analytics applications use HBase.
Traditional relational data models fail to meet the performance requirements of very big databases. These performance and processing limitations can be overcome by Apache HBase.


In big data analytics, Hadoop plays a vital role in solving typical business problems by managing large data sets and gives the best solutions in analytics domain.
In the Hadoop ecosystem, each component plays its unique role for the
In terms of storing unstructured, semi-structured data storage as well as retrieval of such data’s, relational databases are less useful. Also, fetching results by applying query on huge data sets that are stored in Hadoop storage is a challenging task. NoSQL storage technologies provide the best solution for faster querying on huge datasets.
Some of the NoSQL models present in the market are Cassandra, MongoDB, and CouchDB. Each of these models has different ways of storage mechanism.
For example, MongoDB is a document-oriented database from the NoSQL family tree. Compared to traditional databases, it provides the best features in terms of performance, availability, and scalability. It is an open-source document-oriented database, and it’s written in C++.
Cassandra is also a distributed database from open-source Apache software which is designed to handle a huge amount of data stored across commodity servers. Cassandra provides high availability with no single point of failure.
While CouchDB is a document-oriented database in which each document fields are stored in key-value maps.
HBase storage model is different from other NoSQL models discussed above. This can be stated as follow.
MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra are NoSQL type databases that are feature specific and used as per their business needs. Here, we have listed out different NoSQL database as per their use case.
While comparing HBase with Traditional Relational databases, we have to take three key areas into consideration. Those are data model, data storage, and data diversity.
HBase provides unique features and will solve typical industrial use cases. As column-oriented storage, it provides fast querying, fetching of results, and a high amount of data storage. This course is a complete step-by-step introduction to HBase.

In this pytorch tutorial, you will learn all the concepts from scratch. This tutorial covers basic to advanced topics like pytorch definition, advantages and disadvantages of pytorch, comparison, installation, pytorch framework, regression, and image classification. This pytorch tutorial is absolutely free.
PyTorch is an open-source Torch based Machine Learning library for natural language processing using Python. It is similar to NumPy but with powerful GPU support. It offers Dynamic Computational Graphs that you can modify on the go with the help of autograd. PyTorch is also faster than some other frameworks. It was developed by Facebook’s AI Research Group in 2016.
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of PyTorch:
As mentioned above, you can define the network model easily, and you can understand the code quickly without much training.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="738" height="198" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto1.gif" alt="Dynamic Computational Graph">
Image Source: Exploring Deep Learning with PyTorch
Pytorch offers Dynamic Computational Graph (DAG). Computational graphs is a way to express mathematical expressions in graph models or theories such as nodes and edges. The node will do the mathematical operation, and the edge is a Tensor that will be fed into the nodes and carries the output of the node in Tensor.
DAG is a graph that holds arbitrary shape and able to do operations between different input graphs. Every iteration, a new graph is created. So, it is possible to have the same graph structure or create a new graph with a different operation, or we can call it a dynamic graph.
Communities and researchers, benchmark and compare frameworks to see which one is faster.  A GitHub repo Benchmark on Deep Learning Frameworks and GPUs reported that PyTorch is faster than the other framework in terms of images processed per second.
As you can see below, the comparison graphs with vgg16 and resnet152
<img decoding="async" width="764" height="441" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto2.png" alt="Advantages of PyTorch">
<img decoding="async" width="728" height="371" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto3.png" alt="Advantages of PyTorch">
PyTorch is more python based. For example, if you want to train a model,  you can use native control flow such as looping and recursions without the need to add more special variables or sessions to be able to run them. This is very helpful for the training process.
Pytorch also implements Imperative Programming, and it’s definitely more flexible. So, it’s possible to print out the tensor value in the middle of a computation process.
PyTorch requires third-party applications for Visualization. It also needs an API server for production.
Next in this PyTorch tutorial, we will learn about the difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow.
It’s straightforward to install it in Linux. You can choose to use a virtual environment or install it directly with root access. Type this command in the terminal

<img decoding="async" width="782" height="102" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto6.png" alt="AWS Sagemaker">
Finally, In Jupyter, Click on New and choose conda_pytorch_p36 and you are ready to use your notebook instance with Pytorch installed.
Next in this PyTorch tutorial, we will learn about PyTorch framework basics.
Let’s learn the basic concepts of PyTorch before we deep dive. PyTorch uses Tensor for every variable similar to numpy’s ndarray but with GPU computation support.  Here we will explain the network model, loss function, Backprop, and Optimizer.
The network can be constructed by subclassing the torch.nn. There are 2 main parts,
As you can see above, you create a class of nn.Module called Model. It contains 2 Conv2d layers and a Linear layer. The first conv2d layer takes an input of 3 and the output shape of 20. The second layer will take an input of 20 and will produce an output shape of 40. The last layer is a fully connected layer in the shape of 320 and will produce an output of 10.
The forward process will take an input of X and feed it to the conv1 layer and perform ReLU function,
Similarly, it will also feed the conv2 layer. After that, the x will be reshaped into (-1, 320) and feed into the final FC layer. Before you send the output, you will use the softmax activation function.
The backward process is automatically defined by autograd, so you only need to define the forward process.
The loss function is used to measure how well the prediction model is able to predict the expected results. PyTorch already has many standard loss functions in the torch.nn module. For example, you can use the Cross-Entropy Loss to solve a multi-class PyTorch classification problem. It’s easy to define the loss function and compute the losses:
It’s easy to use your own loss function calculation with PyTorch.
To perform the backpropagation, you simply call the los.backward(). The error will be computed but remember to clear the existing gradient with zero_grad()
The torch.optim provides common optimization algorithms. You can define an optimizer with a simple step:
You need to pass the    network model parameters and the learning rate so that at every iteration the parameters will be updated after the backprop process.
Let’s learn simple regression with PyTorch examples:
Step 1) Creating our network model
Our network model is a simple Linear layer with an input and an output shape of 1.
And the network output should be like this
Step 2) Test Data
Before you start the training process, you need to know our data. You make a random function to test our model.   Y = x3 sin(x)+ 3x+0.8 rand(100)
Here is the scatter plot of our function:
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto7.png" alt="Scatter Plot of Simple Regression with PyTorch">
Before you start the training process, you need to convert the numpy array to Variables that supported by Torch and autograd as shown in the below PyTorch regression example.
Step 3) Optimizer and Loss
Next, you should define the Optimizer and the Loss Function for our training process.
Step 4) Training
Now let’s start our training process. With an epoch of 250, you will iterate our data to find the best value for our hyperparameters.
Step 5) Result
As you can see below, you successfully performed PyTorch regression with a neural network. Actually, on every iteration, the red line in the plot will update and change its position to fit the data. But in this picture, it only show you the final result as shown in the below PyTorch example:
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto8.png" alt="Scatter Plot of Simple Regression Result">
One of the popular methods to learn the basics of deep learning is with the MNIST dataset. It is the “Hello World” in deep learning. The dataset contains handwritten numbers from 0 – 9 with the total of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples that are already labeled with the size of 28×28 pixels.
<img decoding="async" width="495" height="494" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto9.png" alt="Image Classification with PyTorch">
Step 1) Preprocess the Data
In the first step of this PyTorch classification example, you will load the dataset using torchvision module.
Before you start the training process, you need to understand the data. Torchvision will load the dataset and transform the images with the appropriate requirement for the network such as the shape and normalizing the images.
The transform function converts the images into tensor and normalizes the value. The function torchvision.transforms.MNIST, will download the dataset (if it’s not available) in the directory, set the dataset for training if necessary and do the transformation process.
To visualize the dataset, you use the data_iterator to get the next batch of images and labels. You use matplot to plot these images and their appropriate label. As you can see below our images and their labels.
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto10.png" alt="Image Classification Example with PyTorch">
Step 2) Network Model Configuration
Now in this PyTorch example, you will make a simple neural network for PyTorch image classification.
Here, we introduce you another way to create the Network model in PyTorch. We will use nn.Sequential to make a sequence model instead of making a subclass of nn.Module.
 Here is the output of our network model
Step 3)Train the Model
Before you start the training process, it is required to set up the criterion and optimizer function.
For the criterion, you will use the CrossEntropyLoss. For the Optimizer, you will use the SGD with a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum of 0.9 as shown in the below PyTorch example.
The forward process will take the input shape and pass it to the first conv2d layer. Then from there, it will be feed into the maxpool2d and finally put into the ReLU activation function. The same process will occur in the second conv2d layer. After that, the input will be reshaped into (-1,320) and feed into the fc layer to predict the output.
Now, you will start the training process. You will iterate through our dataset 2 times or with an epoch of 2 and print out the current loss at every 2000 batch.
At each epoch, the enumerator will get the next tuple of input and corresponding labels. Before we feed the input to our network model, we need to clear the previous gradient. This is required because after the backward process  (backpropagation process), the gradient will be accumulated instead of being replaced. Then, we will calculate the losses from the predicted output from the expected output. After that, we will do a backpropagation to calculate the gradient, and finally, we will update the parameters.
Here’s the output of the training process
Step 4) Test the Model
After you train our model, you need to test or evaluate with other sets of images.
We will use an iterator for the test_loader, and it will generate a batch of images and labels that will be passed to the trained model. The predicted output will be displayed and compared with the expected output.

Keras is an Open Source Neural Network library written in Python that runs on top of Theano or Tensorflow. It is designed to be modular, fast and easy to use. It was developed by François Chollet, a Google engineer. Keras doesn’t handle low-level computation. Instead, it uses another library to do it, called the “Backend.
Keras is high-level API wrapper for the low-level API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Keras High-Level API handles the way we make models, defining layers, or set up multiple input-output models. In this level, Keras also compiles our model with loss and optimizer functions, training process with fit function. Keras in Python doesn’t handle Low-Level API such as making the computational graph, making tensors or other variables because it has been handled by the “backend” engine.
Backend is a term in Keras that performs all low-level computation such as tensor products, convolutions and many other things with the help of other libraries such as Tensorflow or Theano. So, the “backend engine” will perform the computation and development of the models. Tensorflow is the default “backend engine” but we can change it in the configuration.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori1.png" alt="Backend of Theano" width="450" height="144">
Theano is an open source project that was developed by the MILA group at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the first widely used Framework. It is a Python library that helps in multi-dimensional arrays for mathematical operations using Numpy or Scipy. Theano can use GPUs for faster computation, it also can automatically build symbolic graphs for computing gradients. On its website, Theano claims that it can recognize numerically unstable expressions and compute them with more stable algorithms, this is very useful for our unstable expressions.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori2.png" alt="Backend of TensorFlow" width="500" height="93">
On the other hand, Tensorflow is the rising star in deep learning framework. Developed by Google’s Brain team it is the most popular deep learning tool. With a lot of features, and researchers contribute to help develop this framework for deep learning purposes.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori3.jpg" alt="Backend of CNTK" width="640" height="334">
Another backend engine for Keras is The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or CNTK. It is an open-source deep learning framework that was developed by Microsoft Team. It can run on multi GPUs or multi-machine for training deep learning model on a massive scale. In some cases, CNTK was reported faster than other frameworks such as Tensorflow or Theano. Next in this Keras CNN tutorial, we will compare the backends of Theano, TensorFlow and CNTK.
We need to do a benchmark In order to know the comparison between these two backends. As you can see in Jeong-Yoon Lee’s benchmark, the performance of 3 different backends on different hardware is compared. And the result is Theano is slower than the other backend, it is reported 50 times slower, but the accuracy is close to each other.
Another benchmark test is performed by Jasmeet Bhatia. He reported that Theano is slower than Tensorflow for some test. But overall accuracy is nearly the same for every network that was tested.
So, between Theano, Tensorflow and CTK it’s obvious that TensorFlow is better than Theano. With TensorFlow, the computation time is much shorter and CNN is better than the others.
Next in this Keras Python tutorial, we will learn about the difference between Keras and TensorFlow (Keras vs Tensorflow).
Keras is very quick to make a network model. If you want to make a simple network model with a few lines, Python Keras can help you with that. Look at the Keras example below:
Because of friendly the API, we can easily understand the process. Writing the code with a simple function and no need to set multiple parameters.
There are lots of AI communities that use Keras for their Deep Learning framework. Many of them publish their codes as well tutorials to the general public.
You can choose Tensorflow, CNTK, and Theano as your backend with Keras. You can choose a different backend for different projects depending on your needs. Each backend has its own unique advantage.
With a variety of supported devices and platforms, you can deploy Keras on any device like
You can train Keras on a single GPU or use multiple GPUs at once. Because Keras has a built-in support for data parallelism so it can process large volumes of  data and speed up the time needed to train it.
Keras only handles high-level API which runs on top other framework or backend engine such as Tensorflow, Theano, or CNTK. So it’s not very useful if you want to make your own abstract layer for your research purposes because Keras already have pre-configured layers.
In this section, we will look into various methods available to install Keras
Which one is better? Direct install to the current python or use a virtual environment? I suggest using a virtual environment if you have many projects. Want to know why? This is because different projects may use a different version of a keras library.
For example, I have a project that needs Python 3.5 using OpenCV 3.3 with older Keras-Theano backend but in the other project I have to use Keras with the latest version and a Tensorflow as it backend with Python 3.6.6 support
We don’t want the Keras library to conflict at each other right? So we use a Virtual Environment to localize the project with a specific type of library or we can use another platform such as Cloud Service to do our computation for us like Amazon Web Service.
Amazon Web Service is a platform that offers Cloud Computing service and products for researchers or any other purposes. AWS rent their hardware, networking, Database, etc. so that we can use it directly from the internet. One of the popular AWS service for deep learning purpose is the Amazon Machine Image Deep Learning Service or DL
For detailed instructions on how to use AWS, refer this tutorial
Note on the AMI: You will have the following AMI available
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori4.png" alt="Installing Keras on AWS" width="1148" height="461">
AWS Deep Learning AMI is a virtual environment in AWS EC2 Service that helps researchers or practitioners to work with Deep Learning. DLAMI offers from small CPUs engine up to high-powered multi GPUs engines with preconfigured CUDA, cuDNN, and comes with a variety of deep learning frameworks.
If you want to use it instantly, you should choose Deep Learning AMI because it comes preinstalled with  popular deep learning frameworks.
But if you want to try a custom deep learning framework for research, you should install the Deep Learning Base AMI because it comes with fundamental libraries such as CUDA, cuDNN, GPUs drivers, and other needed libraries to run with your deep learning environment.
Amazon SageMaker is a deep learning platform to help you with training and deploying deep learning network with the best algorithm.
As a beginner, this is by far the easiest method to use Keras. Below is a process on how to install Keras on Amazon SageMaker:
Step 1) Open Amazon SageMaker
In the first step, Open the Amazon Sagemaker console and click on  Create notebook instance.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori5.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="1322" height="215">
Step 2) Enter the details
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori6.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="840" height="1034">
Note: If you want to access resources from your VPC, set the direct internet access as enabled. Otherwise, this notebook instance will not have an internet access, so it is impossible to train or host models
Step 3) Launch the instance
Click on Open to launch the instance
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori7.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="782" height="102">
Step 4) Start coding
In Jupyter, Click on New> conda_tensorflow_p36 and you are ready to code
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori8.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="683" height="486">
To enable Keras with Tensorflow as its backend engine, we need to install Tensorflow first. Run this command to install tensorflow with CPU (no GPU)
if you want to enable the GPU support for tensorflow you can use this command
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori9.png" alt="Install Keras on Linux" width="599" height="637">
let’s check in Python to see if our installation is successful by typing
if there is no error message, the installation process is successful
After we install Tensorflow, let’s start installing keras. Type this command in the terminal
it will begin installing Keras and also all of its dependencies.You should see something like this :
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori10.png" alt="Install Keras" width="716" height="339">
Now we have Keras Installed in our system!
Before we start using Keras, we should check if our Keras use Tensorflow as it backend by open the configuration file:
you should see something like this
as you can see, the “backend” use tensorflow. It means that keras are using Tensorflow as it backend as we expected
and now run it on the terminal by typing
Before we install Tensorflow and Keras, we should install Python, pip, and virtualenv. If you already installed these libraries, you should continue to the next step, otherwise do this:
Install Python 3 by downloading from this link
Install pip by running this
Install virtualenv with this command
Install Microsoft Visual C++  2015 Redistributable Update 3
Then run this script
Setup Virtual Environment
This is used to isolate the working system with the main system.
Activate the environment
After preparing the environment, Tensorflow and Keras installation remains same as Linux. Next in this Deep learning with Keras tutorial, we will learn about Keras fundamentals for Deep learning.


The main structure in Keras is the Model which defines the complete graph of a network. You can add more layers to an existing model to build a custom model that you need for your project.
Here’s how to make a Sequential Model and a few commonly used layers in deep learning
1. Sequential Model
2. Convolutional Layer
This is a Keras Python example of convolutional layer as the input layer with the input shape of 320x320x3, with 48 filters of size 3×3 and use ReLU as an activation function.
another type is
3. MaxPooling Layer
To downsample the input representation, use MaxPool2d and specify the kernel size
4. Dense Layer
adding a Fully Connected Layer with just specifying the output Size
5. Dropout Layer
Adding dropout layer with 50% probability
Compiling, Training, and Evaluate
After we define our model, let’s start to train them. It is required to compile the network first with the loss function and optimizer function. This will allow the network to change weights and minimized the loss.
Now to start training, use fit to fed the training and validation data to the model. This will allow you to train the network in batches and set the epochs.
Our final step is to evaluate the model with the test data.
Lets try using simple linear regression
After training the data, the output should look like this
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori11.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="640" height="480">
with the initial weight
and final weight
Why we use Fine Tune Models and when we use it
Fine-tuning is a task to tweak a pre-trained model such that the parameters would adapt to the new model. When we want to train from scratch on a new model, we need a large amount of data, so that the network can find all parameters. But in this case, we will use a pre-trained model so the parameters are already learned and have a weight.
For example, if we want to train our own Keras model to solve a classification problem but we only have a small amount of data, then we can solve this by using a Transfer Learning + Fine-Tuning method.
Using a pre-trained network & weights we don’t need to train the whole network. We just need to train the last layer that is used to solve our task as we call it Fine-Tuning method.
For the pre-trained model, we can load a variety of models that Keras already has in its library such as:
But in this process, we will use VGG16 network model and the imageNet as our weight for the model. We will fine-tune a network to classify 8 different types of classes using Images from Kaggle Natural Images Dataset
VGG16 model architecture
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori12.png" alt="VGG16 model architecture" width="470" height="331">
source
For our training process, we will use a picture of natural images from 8 different classes such as airplanes, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike, and person. First, we need to upload our data to Amazon S3 Bucket.
Step 1) After login to your S3 account, let’s create a bucket by clocking Create Bucket
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori13.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="350" height="111">
Step 2) Now choose a Bucket Name and your Region according to your account. Make sure that the bucket name is available. After that click Create.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori14.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="469" height="394">
Step 3) As you can see, your Bucket is ready to use. But as you can see, the Access is Not public, it is good for you if you want to keep it private for yourself. You can change this bucket for Public Access in the Bucket Properties
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori15.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="462" height="165">
Step 4) Now you start uploading your training data to your Bucket. Here I will upload the tar.gz file which consist of pictures for training and testing process.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori16.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="931" height="272">
Step 5) Now click on your file and copy the Link so that we can download it.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori17.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="317" height="214">
We need to generate our training data using the Keras ImageDataGenerator.
First you must download using wget with the link to your file from S3 Bucket.
After you download the data let’s start the Training Process.
The ImageDataGenerator will make an X_training data from a directory. The sub-directory in that directory will be used as a class for each object. The image will be loaded with the RGB color mode, with the categorical class mode for the Y_training data, with a batch size of 16.  Finally, shuffle the data.
Let’s see our images randomly by plotting them with matplotlib
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori18.png" alt="Data Preparation" width="640" height="480">
After that let’s create our network model from VGG16 with imageNet pre-trained weight. We will freeze these layers so that the layers are not trainable to help us reduce the computation time.
As you can see below, the summary of our network model. From an input from VGG16 Layers, then we add 2 Fully Connected Layer which will extract 1024 features and an output layer that will compute the 8 classes with the softmax activation.
Results
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori19.png" alt="Training" width="640" height="480">
As you can see, our losses are dropped significantly and the accuracy is almost 100%. For testing our model, we randomly picked images over the internet and put it on the test folder with a different class to test
And our test is as given below! Only 1 image is predicted wrong from a test of 14 images!
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori20.png" alt="Testing Model" width="1024" height="564">
We need Recognition to make it easier for us to recognize or identify a person’s face, objects type, estimated age of a person from his face, or even know the facial expressions of that person.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori21.png" alt="Face Recognition Neural Network with Keras" width="396" height="130">
Maybe you realize every time you try to mark your friend’s face in a photo, the feature in Facebook has done it for you, that is marking your friend’s face without you needing to mark it first. This is Face Recognition applied by Facebook to make it easier for us to tag friends.
So how does it work? Every time we mark the face of our friend, Facebook’s AI will learn it and will try to predict it until it gets the right result. The same system we will use to make our own Face Recognition. Let’s start making our own Face Recognition using Deep Learning
We will use a VGG16 Network Model but with VGGFace weight.
VGG16 model architecture
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori22.png" alt="Network Model" width="470" height="276">
What is VGGFace? it is Keras implementation of Deep Face Recognition introduced by Parkhi, Omkar M. et al. “Deep Face Recognition.” BMVC (2015). The framework uses VGG16 as the network architecture.
You can download the VGGFace from github
As you can see the network summary
we will do a Transfer Learning + Fine Tuning to make the training quicker with small datasets. First, we will freeze the base layers so that the layers are not trainable.
then we add our own layer to recognize our test faces. We will add 2 fully connected layer and an output layer with 5 people to detect.
Let’s see our network summary
As you can see above, after the pool5 layer, it will be flattened into a single feature vector that will be used by the dense layer for the final recognition.
Now let’s prepare our faces. I made a directory consist of 5 famous people
Each folder contains 10 pictures, for each training and evaluation process. It is a very small amount of data but that is the challenge, right?
We will use the help of Keras tool to help us prepare the data. This function will iterate in the dataset folder and then prepare it so it can be used in the training.
Let’s begin our training process by compiling our network with loss function and optimizer. Here, we use sparse_categorical_crossentropy as our loss function, with the help of SGD as our learning optimizer.
As you can see, our validation accuracy is up to 64%, this is a good result for a small amount of training data. We can improve this by adding more layer or add more training images so that our model can learn more about the faces and achieving more accuracy.
Let’s test our model with a test picture
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori23.jpg" alt="Test Picture" width="320" height="320">
using Robert Downey Jr. picture as our test picture, it shows that the predicted face is true!
How about if we test our skill with implementing it with an input from a webcam? Using OpenCV with Haar Face cascade to find our face and with the help of our network model, we can recognize the person.
The first step is to prepare you and your friend’s faces. The more data we have then the better the result is!
Prepare and train your network like the previous step, after training is complete, add this line to get the input image from cam
Keras offers simplicity when writing the script. We can start writing and understand directly with Keras as it’s not too hard to understand. It is more user-friendly and easy to implement, no need to make many variables to run the model. So, we don’t need to understand every detail in the backend process.
On the other hand, Tensorflow is the low-level operations that offer flexibility and advanced operations if you want to make an arbitrary computational graph or model. Tensorflow also can visualize the process with the help of TensorBoard and a specialized debugger tool.
So, if you want to start working with deep learning with not that much complexity, use Keras. Because Keras offers simplicity and user-friendly to use and easy to implement than Tensorflow. But if you want to write your own algorithm in deep learning project or research, you should use Tensorflow instead.
So let’s summarize everything we have discussed and done in this tutorial.

A project is a series of tasks that need to be completed within a specified time, in order to achieve the planned outcome. The planning, scheduling, tracking, and collaboration are overseen by one or many project managers, depending on how complex the project is. Project management is the process of piloting teams towards their predefined goals within the specified time through planning, tracking and execution, usually under the guidance of a project manager. Nowadays, online project management is more popular than ever, with the remote working model gaining significant momentum. However, it is essential to choose an online project management tool that caters to your unique business needs to get the best outcome.
 Project management allows businesses to plan efficiently, without straying from the big picture. When everyone knows what they're working on, a positive working environment is fostered. Moreover, with project management, teams can allocate each member with an optimum amount of work that they are accountable for, laying the foundation for proper resource utilization. It also helps with consistent tracking so that your teams know where your project stands at every juncture, leading to increased productivity.
 Whether it is a large conglomerate or a nascent start-up, organizations of any size can use project management; be it a construction company or a healthcare center, project management helps with managing work in any industry. Freelancers, consultants, students, or anyone having a stretch of tasks with an end goal can benefit from project management.
 Efficient task management helps in breaking complex work items into manageable portions. Optimum resource utilization helps get the most out of teams by allocating work wisely. Acute time tracking helps monitor the time that each task takes to complete. Proper budget estimation helps track your expenses and learn whether your project is over or under budget. Seamless collaboration allows teams to participate in brainstorming sessions and discussions.
 Project management gives your project purpose, a framework, and a ground-plan, through planning, tracking, collaboration and execution of tasks that are assigned to resources. With project management, you can streamline all the processes required to attain your goals, keep everyone in the loop through continuous communication, track every phase of the project closely and move past hiccups. It helps your teams stay organized, stay on the same page, and stay accountable!
 Monitoring every stage allows for rigorous tracking of the project, phase by phase. Streamlining processes and having people accountable for their tasks helps do away with clutter and confusion. Project management helps identify bottlenecks so that you can swiftly swerve across bottlenecks to avoid any slips, trips and falls. Communication within and across teams becomes efficient and seamless when your teams are on the same page, thereby helping you achieve your ultimate target.
 A good online project management software is one that is intuitive, customizable and user-friendly, helps you navigate through all your widgets smoothly without jumping tabs, and customize your dashboards as per your preference.

Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.
Some prefer saying Software testing definition as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application Under Test (AUT). This Software Testing course introduces testing software to the audience and justifies the importance of software testing.
Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

Unit Testing:  This software testing basic approach is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developers to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.
Integration testing: It focuses on the construction and design of the software. You need to see that the integrated units are working without errors or not.
System testing: In this method, your software is compiled as a whole and then tested as a whole. This testing strategy checks the functionality, security, portability, amongst others.
Program Testing in software testing is a method of executing an actual software program with the aim of testing program behavior and finding errors. The software program is executed with test case data to analyse the program behavior or response to the test data. A good program testing is one which has high chances of finding bugs.

Background
It is important that you achieve optimum test results while conducting software testing without deviating from the goal. But how you determine that you are following the right strategy for testing? For that, you need to stick to some basic testing principles. Here are the common seven testing principles that are widely practiced in the software industry.
To understand this, consider a scenario where you are moving a file from folder A to Folder B.
Think of all the possible ways you can test this.
Apart from the usual scenarios, you can also test the following conditions
If you were to test the entire possible combinations project EXECUTION TIME & COSTS would rise exponentially. We need certain principles and strategies to optimize the testing effort

Yes! Exhaustive testing is not possible. Instead, we need the optimal amount of testing based on the risk assessment of the application.
And the million dollar question is, how do you determine this risk?
To answer this let’s do an exercise
In your opinion, Which operation is most likely to cause your Operating system to fail?
I am sure most of you would have guessed, Opening 10 different application all at the same time.
So if you were testing this Operating system, you would realize that defects are likely to be found in multi-tasking activity and need to be tested thoroughly which brings us to our next principle Defect Clustering
Defect Clustering which states that a small number of modules contain most of the defects detected. This is the application of the Pareto Principle to software testing: approximately 80% of the problems are found in 20% of the modules.
By experience, you can identify such risky modules. But this approach has its own problems
If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test cases will no longer find new bugs.
Repetitive use of the same pesticide mix to eradicate insects during farming will over time lead to the insects developing resistance to the pesticide Thereby ineffective of pesticides on insects. The same applies to software testing. If the same set of repetitive tests are conducted, the method will be useless for discovering new defects.
To overcome this, the test cases need to be regularly reviewed & revised, adding new & different test cases to help find more defects.
Testers cannot simply depend on existing test techniques. He must look out continually to improve the existing methods to make testing more effective. But even after all this sweat & hard work in testing, you can never claim your product is bug-free. To drive home this point, let’s see this video of the public launch of Windows 98
You think a company like MICROSOFT would not have tested their OS thoroughly & would risk their reputation just to see their OS crashing during its public launch!


Hence, testing principle states that – Testing talks about the presence of defects and don’t talk about the absence of defects. i.e. Software Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness.
But what if, you work extra hard, taking all precautions & make your software product 99% bug-free. And the software does not meet the needs & requirements of the clients.
This leads us to our next principle, which states that- Absence of Error
It is possible that software which is 99% bug-free is still unusable. This can be the case if the system is tested thoroughly for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not mere finding defects, but also to check that software addresses the business needs. The absence of Error is a Fallacy i.e. Finding and fixing defects does not help if the system build is unusable and does not fulfill the user’s needs & requirements.
To solve this problem, the next principle of testing states that Early Testing
Early Testing – Testing should start as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle. So that any defects in the requirements or design phase are captured in early stages. It is much cheaper to fix a Defect in the early stages of testing. But how early one should start testing? It is recommended that you start finding the bug the moment the requirements are defined. More on this principle in a later training tutorial.


Testing is context dependent which basically means that the way you test an e-commerce site will be different from the way you test a commercial off the shelf application. All the developed software’s are not identical. You might use a different approach, methodologies, techniques, and types of testing depending upon the application type. For instance testing, any POS system at a retail store will be different than testing an ATM machine.
This is so very untrue. Test Principles will help you create an effective Test Strategy and draft error catching test cases.
But learning testing principles is just like learning to drive for the first time.
Initially, while you learn to drive, you pay attention to each and everything like gear shifts, speed, clutch handling, etc. But with experience, you just focus on driving the rest comes naturally. Such that you even hold conversations with other passengers in the car.
Same is true for testing principles. Experienced testers have internalized these principles to a level that they apply them even without thinking. Hence the myth that the principles are not used in practice is simply not true.

V Model is a highly disciplined SDLC model which has a testing phase parallel to each development phase. The V model is an extension of the waterfall model wherein software development and testing is executed in a sequential way. It is known as the Validation or Verification Model.

SDLC: SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle. It is the sequence of activities carried out by Developers to design and develop high-quality software.
STLC: STLC is Software Testing Life Cycle. It consists of a series of activities carried out by Testers methodologically to test your software product.
Waterfall Model: Waterfall model is a sequential model divided into different phases of software development activity. Each stage is designed for performing the specific activity. Testing phase in waterfall model starts only after implementation of the system is done.

All these levels constitute the waterfall method of the software development lifecycle.
As you may observe, that testing in the model starts only after implementation is done.
But if you are working in the large project, where the systems are complex, it’s easy to miss out the key details in the requirements phase itself. In such cases, an entirely wrong product will be delivered to the client and you might have to start afresh with the project OR if you manage to note the requirements correctly but make serious mistakes in design and architecture of your software you will have to redesign the entire software to correct the error.
Assessments of thousands of projects have shown that defects introduced during requirements & design make up close to half of the total number of defects.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/qwer.png" alt="Problem with the Waterfall Model" width="500" height="367">
Also, the costs of fixing a defect increase across the development lifecycle. The earlier in life cycle a defect is detected, the cheaper it is to fix it. As they say, “A stitch in time saves nine.”
To address this concern, the V model of testing was developed where for every phase, in the Development life cycle there is a corresponding Testing phase
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/6-2015/052715_0904_GuidetoSDLC3.png" alt="Solution: The V Model" width="595" height="347">
Apart from the V model, there are iterative development models, where development is carried in phases, with each phase adding a functionality to the software. Each phase comprises its independent set of development and testing activities.
Good examples of Development lifecycles following iterative method are Rapid Application Development, Agile Development
There are numerous development life cycle models. Development model selected for a project depends on the aims and goals of that project.

Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to ensure software quality goals are met. STLC involves both verification and validation activities. Contrary to popular belief, Software Testing is not just a single/isolate activity, i.e. testing. It consists of a series of activities carried out methodologically to help certify your software product. STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.
There are following six major phases in every Software Testing Life Cycle Model (STLC Model):
Each of these stages has a definite Entry and Exit criteria, Activities & Deliverables associated with it.

Requirement Phase Testing also known as Requirement Analysis in which test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify testable requirements and the QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand requirements in detail. Requirements could be either functional or non-functional. Automation feasibility for the testing project is also done in this stage.
Activities in Requirement Phase Testing
Deliverables of Requirement Phase Testing
Test Planning in STLC is a phase in which a Senior QA manager determines the test plan strategy along with efforts and cost estimates for the project. Moreover, the resources, test environment, test limitations and the testing schedule are also determined. The Test Plan gets prepared and finalized in the same phase.
Test Planning Activities
Deliverables of Test Planning
The Test Case Development Phase involves the creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts after the test plan is ready. Initially, the Test data is identified then created and reviewed and then reworked based on the preconditions. Then the QA team starts the development process of test cases for individual units.
Test Case Development Activities
Deliverables of Test Case Development
Test Environment Setup decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is tested. It is one of the critical aspects of the testing process and can be done in parallel with the Test Case Development Phase. Test team may not be involved in this activity if the development team provides the test environment. The test team is required to do a readiness check (smoke testing) of the given environment.
Test Environment Setup Activities
Deliverables of Test Environment Setup
Test Execution Phase is carried out by the testers in which testing of the software build is done based on test plans and test cases prepared. The process consists of test script execution, test script maintenance and bug reporting. If bugs are reported then it is reverted back to development team for correction and retesting will be performed.
Test Execution Activities
Deliverables of Test Execution
Test Cycle Closure phase is completion of test execution which involves several activities like test completion reporting, collection of test completion matrices and test results. Testing team members meet, discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be implemented in future, taking lessons from current test cycle. The idea is to remove process bottlenecks for future test cycles.

Manual Testing is a type of software testing in which test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools. The purpose of Manual Testing is to identify the bugs, issues, and defects in the software application. Manual software testing is the most primitive technique of all testing types and it helps to find critical bugs in the software application.
Any new application must be manually tested before its testing can be automated. Manual Software Testing requires more effort but is necessary to check automation feasibility. Manual Testing concepts does not require knowledge of any testing tool. One of the Software Testing Fundamental is “100% Automation is not possible“. This makes Manual Testing imperative.

The key concept of manual testing is to ensure that the application is error free and it is working in conformance to the specified functional requirements.
Test Suites or cases, are designed during the testing phase and should have 100% test coverage.
It also makes sure that reported defects are fixed by developers and re-testing has been performed by testers on the fixed defects.
Basically, this testing checks the quality of the system and delivers bug-free product to the customer.

Below given diagram depicts Manual Testing Types. In fact, any type of software testing type can be executed both manually as well using an automation tool.
Following are few common myths and facts related to testing:
Myth: Anyone can do manual testing
Fact: Testing requires many skill sets
Myth: Testing ensures 100% Defect free product
Fact: Testing attempts to find as many defects as possible. Identifying all possible defects is impossible.
Myth: Automated testing is more powerful than manual testing
Fact: 100% test automation cannot be done. Manual Software Testing is also essential.
Myth: Testing is easy
Fact: Testing can be extremely challenging. Testing an application for possible use cases with minimum test cases requires high analytical skills. 

Manual testing is an activity where the tester needs to be very patient, creative & open minded.
Manual testing is a vital part of user-friendly software development because humans are involved in testing software applications and end-users are also humans. They need to think and act with an End User perspective.

Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.
Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool, it’s possible to record this test suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required. This improved ROI of Test Automation. The goal of Automation is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not to eliminate Manual Testing altogether.

Test cases to be automated can be selected using the following criterion to increase the automation ROI
The following category of test cases are not suitable for automation:
Following steps are followed in an Automation Process
Step 1) Test Tool Selection
Step 2) Define scope of Automation
Step 3) Planning, Design and Development
Step 4) Test Execution
Step 5) Maintenance
Test Tool selection largely depends on the technology the Application Under Test is built on. For instance, QTP does not support Informatica. So QTP cannot be used for testing Informatica applications. It’s a good idea to conduct a Proof of Concept of Tool on AUT.
The scope of automation is the area of your Application Under Test which will be automated. Following points help determine scope:
During this phase, you create an Automation strategy & plan, which contains the following details-
Automation Scripts are executed during this phase. The scripts need input test data before there are set to run. Once executed they provide detailed test reports.
Execution can be performed using the automation tool directly or through the Test Management tool which will invoke the automation tool.
Example: Quality center is the Test Management tool which in turn it will invoke QTP for execution of automation scripts. Scripts can be executed in a single machine or a group of machines. The execution can be done during the night, to save time.
Test Automation Maintenance Approach is an automation testing phase carried out to test whether the new functionalities added to the software are working fine or not. Maintenance in automation testing is executed when new automation scripts are added and need to be reviewed and maintained in order to improve the effectiveness of automation scripts with each successive release cycle.
A framework is set of automation guidelines which help in
There are four types of frameworks used in automation software testing:

The above guidelines if observed can greatly help in making your automation successful.
Following are the Test Automation benefits:
Selecting the right tool can be a tricky task. Following criterion will help you select the best tool for your requirement-
Tool selection is one of biggest challenges to be tackled before going for automation. First, Identify the requirements, explore various tools and its capabilities, set the expectation from the tool and go for a Proof Of Concept.

Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness.  A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.
In SDLC, STLC, V Model, Unit testing is first level of testing done before integration testing. Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. Though, in a practical world due to time crunch or reluctance of developers to tests, QA engineers also do unit testing.

Unit Testing is important because software developers sometimes try saving time doing minimal unit testing and this is myth because inappropriate unit testing leads to high cost Defect fixing during System Testing, Integration Testing and even Beta Testing after application is built. If proper unit testing is done in early development, then it saves time and money in the end.

Here, are the key reasons to perform unit testing in software engineering:

In order to execute Unit Tests, developers write a section of code to test a specific function in software application. Developers can also isolate this function to test more rigorously which reveals unnecessary dependencies between function being tested and other units so the dependencies can be eliminated. Developers generally use UnitTest framework to develop automated test cases for unit testing.
Unit Testing is of two types
Unit testing is commonly automated but may still be performed manually. Software Engineering does not favor one over the other but automation is preferred. A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document.
Under the automated approach-
The Unit Testing Techniques are mainly categorized into three parts which are Black box testing that involves testing of user interface along with input and output, White box testing that involves testing the functional behaviour of the software application and Gray box testing that is used to execute test suites, test methods, test cases and performing risk analysis.
Code coverage techniques used in Unit Testing are listed below:
For more in refer https://www.guru99.com/code-coverage.html
Unit testing relies on mock objects being created to test sections of code that are not yet part of a complete application. Mock objects fill in for the missing parts of the program.
For example, you might have a function that needs variables or objects that are not created yet. In unit testing, those will be accounted for in the form of mock objects created solely for the purpose of the unit testing done on that section of code.
There are several automated unit test software available to assist with unit testing in software testing. We will provide a few examples below:
Those are just a few of the available unit testing tools. There are lots more, especially for C languages and Java, but you are sure to find a unit testing tool for your programming needs regardless of the language you use.
Unit testing in TDD involves an extensive use of testing frameworks. A unit test framework is used in order to create automated unit tests. Unit testing frameworks are not unique to TDD, but they are essential to it. Below we look at some of what TDD brings to the world of unit testing:
Myth: It requires time, and I am always overscheduled
My code is rock solid! I do not need unit tests.
Myths by their very nature are false assumptions. These assumptions lead to a vicious cycle as follows –
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/unit-testing.png" alt="UNIT Testing Myth" width="553" height="495">
Truth is Unit testing increase the speed of development.
Programmers think that Integration Testing will catch all errors and do not execute the unit test. Once units are integrated, very simple errors which could have very easily found and fixed in unit tested take a very long time to be traced and fixed.
It’s recommended unit testing be used in conjunction with other testing activities.

Integration Testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules when they are integrated
Integration Testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these modules. Hence it is also termed as ‘I & T’ (Integration and Testing), ‘String Testing’ and sometimes ‘Thread Testing’.

Integration Test Case differs from other test cases in the sense it focuses mainly on the interfaces & flow of data/information between the modules. Here priority is to be given for the integrating links rather than the unit functions which are already tested.
Sample Integration Test Cases for the following scenario: Application has 3 modules say ‘Login Page’, ‘Mailbox’ and ‘Delete emails’ and each of them is integrated logically.
Here do not concentrate much on the Login Page testing as it’s already been done in Unit Testing. But check how it’s linked to the Mail Box Page.
Similarly Mail Box: Check its integration to the Delete Mails Module.
Software Engineering defines variety of strategies to execute Integration testing, viz.
Below are the different strategies, the way they are executed and their limitations as well advantages.
Big Bang Testing is an Integration testing approach in which all the components or modules are integrated together at once and then tested as a unit. This combined set of components is considered as an entity while testing. If all of the components in the unit are not completed, the integration process will not execute.
 Advantages:
 Disadvantages:
In the Incremental Testing approach, testing is done by integrating two or more modules that are logically related to each other and then tested for proper functioning of the application. Then the other related modules are integrated incrementally and the process continues until all the logically related modules are integrated and tested successfully.
Incremental Approach, in turn, is carried out by two different Methods:
Stubs and Drivers are the dummy programs in Integration testing used to facilitate the software testing activity. These programs act as a substitutes for the missing models in the testing. They do not implement the entire programming logic of the software module but they simulate data communication with the calling module while testing.
Stub: Is called by the Module under Test.
Driver: Calls the Module to be tested.
Bottom-up Integration Testing is a strategy in which the lower level modules are tested first. These tested modules are then further used to facilitate the testing of higher level modules. The process continues until all modules at top level are tested. Once the lower level modules are tested and integrated, then the next level of modules are formed.

 Advantages:
 Disadvantages:
Top Down Integration Testing is a method in which integration testing takes place from top to bottom following the control flow of software system. The higher level modules are tested first and then lower level modules are tested and integrated in order to check the software functionality. Stubs are used for testing if some modules are not ready.
Diagrammatic Representation:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/top-down-integration-testing.png" alt="Top-down Integration Testing" width="675" height="341">
 Advantages:
 Disadvantages:
Sandwich Testing is a strategy in which top level modules are tested with lower level modules at the same time lower modules are integrated with top modules and tested as a system. It is a combination of Top-down and Bottom-up approaches therefore it is called Hybrid Integration Testing. It makes use of both stubs as well as drivers.

A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, and postcondition developed for a specific test scenario to verify any requirement. The test case includes specific variables or conditions, using which a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer.

A Test Scenario is defined as any functionality that can be tested. It is a collective set of test cases which helps the testing team to determine the positive and negative characteristics of the project.
Test Scenario gives a high-level idea of what we need to test.
For an eCommerce Application, a few test scenarios would be
Test Scenario 1: Check the Search Functionality
Test Scenario 2: Check the Payments Functionality
Test Scenario 3: Check the Login Functionality

API Testing is a software testing type that validates Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The purpose of API Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs(keyboard) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the system’s response. API tests are very different from GUI Tests and won’t concentrate on the look and feel of an application. It mainly concentrates on the business logic layer of the software architecture.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1-2015/api_testing.png" alt="API Testing image" width="557" height="223">
For background, API (Application Programming Interface) is a computing interface that enables communication and data exchange between two separate software systems. A software system that executes an API includes several functions/subroutines that another software system can perform. API defines requests that can be made, how to make requests, data formats that can be used, etc., between two software systems.

API automation Testing requires an application that can be interacted via an API. In order to test an API, you will need to
Few Points to note
An output of API could be
Let’s look at an example of each of the above Types in this API testing tutorial

Example: There is an API function that should add two integer numbers.
The numbers have to be given as input parameters. The output should be a summation of two integer numbers. This output needs to be verified with an expected outcome.
Calling needs to be done such as
Exceptions have to be handled if the number is exceeding the integer limit.
Consider the below API function –
They return any value such as True (in case of success) or false (In case of error) as an output.
A more accurate Test Case would be, can call the functions in any of the scripts and later check for changes either in the database or the Application GUI.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1-2015/010915_1247_Beforegoing2.png" alt="Calling of another API / Event" width="113" height="122">
In this case, we call one of the API function which in turn will call another function.
For example – First API function can be used for deleting a specified record in the table and this function, in turn, calls another function to REFRESH the database.
Test cases of API testing are based on
API Testing Approach is a predefined strategy or a method that the QA team will perform in order to conduct the API testing after the build is ready. This testing does not include the source code. The API testing approach helps to better understand the functionalities, testing techniques, input parameters and the execution of test cases.
The following points helps the user to do an API Testing approach:

The course is designed for SQL beginners. No prior DB experience is required.
MariaDB
A database management system (DBMS) is a software used to store and manage data. It guarantees the quality, durability, and confidentiality of information. The most popular type of DBMS are  Relational Database Management Systems, or RDBMSs. Here,  the database consists of a structured set of tables and each row of a table is a record.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a DBMS. In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS. Following are types of SQL Statements
A Query is a set of instruction given to the database management system. It tells any database what information you would like to get from the database. For example, to fetch the student name from the database table STUDENT, you can write the SQL Query like this:
When you want to execute an SQL command for any DBMS system, you need to find the best method to carry out your request, and SQL engine determines how to interpret that specific task.
Important  components included in this SQL process are:
A classic query engine allows you to manage all the non-SQL queries.

Database Testing is a type of software testing that checks the schema, tables, triggers, etc. of the Database under test. It also checks data integrity and consistency. It may involve creating complex queries to load/stress test the Database and check its responsiveness.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="250" height="200" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/database-testing.png" alt="Database Testing">
Database Testing is important in software testing because it ensures data values and information received and stored into database are valid or not. Database testing helps to save data loss, saves aborted transaction data and no unauthorized access to the information. Database is important for any software application hence testers must have good knowledge of SQL for database testing.
The GUI is usually given the most emphasis by the test and development team members since the Graphical User Interface happens to be the most visible part of the application. However, what is also important is to validate the information that is the heart of the application, aka DATABASE.
Let us consider a Banking application wherein a user makes transactions. Now from Database Testing or DB Testing viewpoint following, things are important:
To ensure all these above objectives, we need to use data validation or data testing.

<img decoding="async" width="933" height="371" title="Database(Data) Testing Tutorial with Sample TestCases" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/typeofdbtest.jpg" alt="Types of Database Testing">
The 3 types of Database Testing are
In this Database Testing tutorial, we will look into each type and its sub-types one by one.
Structural Database Testing is a database testing technique that validates all the elements inside data repository that are mainly used for data storage and which are not allowed to be directly manipulated by end-users. The validation of database servers is also an important consideration in structural database testing. A successful completion of this testing needs mastery in SQL queries.
Schema Testing in database testing validates various schema formats associated with the database and verifies whether the mapping formats of tables/views/columns are compatible with mapping formats of user interface. The main purpose of schema testing is to ensure the schema mapping between front-end and back-end are similar. Thus, it is also referred to as mapping testing.
Let us discuss the most important checkpoints for schema testing.
Let us also look at some of the interesting Database Testing tools for validating database schemas.
For example, if the developers want to change a table structure or delete it, the tester would want to ensure that all the Stored Procedures and Views that use that table are compatible with the particular change. Another example could be that if the testers want to check for schema changes between 2 databases, they can do that by using simple queries.
Let us look into various checks for database and column testing.
of the back-end database columns with that of those present at the front-end of the application.
Important checks for keys and indexes –
constraints have been created on the required tables.
have been created on the required tables as specified by the business requirements.
Important tests to check stored procedures are:
Some of the useful Database Testing tools for testing stored procedures are LINQ , SP Test tool etc.

Functional Database Testing is a type of database testing that is used to validate the functional requirements of a database from the end-user’s perspective. The main goal of functional database testing is to test whether the transactions and operations performed by the end-users which are related to the database works as expected or not.
Following are the basic conditions that need to be observed for database validations.
This particular process is the validation of the field mappings from the end-user viewpoint. In this particular scenario, the tester would perform an operation at the database level and then would navigate to the relevant user interface item to observe and validate whether the proper field validations have been carried out or not.
The vice versa condition whereby, first operation is carried out by the tester at the user interface, and then the same is validated from the back end is should also be done.
Following checks are important
The validations of the login and user security credentials need to take into consideration the following things.
Non-functional testing in the context of database testing can be categorized into various categories as required by the business requirements. These can be load testing, Stress Testing, Security Testing, Usability Testing, and Compatibility Testing, and so on. The load testing, as well as stress testing, which can be grouped under the gamut of Performance Testing serves two specific purposes when it comes to the role of non-functional testing.
Risk quantification– Quantification of risk helps the stakeholders to ascertain the various system response time requirements under required levels of load. This is the original intent of any quality assurance task. We need to note that load testing does not mitigate risk directly, but through the processes of risk identification and risk quantification, presents corrective opportunities and an impetus for remediation that will mitigate risk.
Minimum system equipment requirement– The minimum system configuration that will allow the system to meet the formally stated performance expectations of stakeholders. So that extraneous hardware, software, and the associated cost of ownership can be minimized. This particular requirement can be categorized as the overall business optimization requirement.
The purpose of any load test should be clearly understood and documented. The following types of configurations are a must for load testing.
Important load testing tools are LoadRunner Professional, win runner and JMeter.

Database Stress Testing is a testing method used to stress test database system with heavy load such that it fails at some point. This helps in identifying the breakdown point of database system. It requires proper planning and efforts in order to avoid over usage of resources. Data stress testing is also known as torturous testing or fatigue testing.
Important stress testing tools are LoadRunner Professional and JMeter.
Solution: The overall process planning and timing should be organized so that no time and cost based issues appear.
Solution: A prior plan and methodology for test data generation should be at hand.
Solution: Maintenance of the SQL queries and their continuous updating is a significant part of the overall testing process which should be part of the overall test strategy.
Solution: There should be a fine balance between quality and overall project schedule duration.
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" title="Database(Data) Testing Tutorial with Sample TestCases" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/truth.png" alt="Myths">
Reality: Effective and efficient Database Testing in Software Testing provides long-term functional stability to the overall application thus it is necessary to put in hard work behind it.
Reality: On the contrary, database testing adds more value to the overall work by finding out hidden issues and thus pro-actively helping to improve the overall application.
Reality: Significant amount of database testing helps in the overall improvement of quality for the database application.
Reality: Any expenditure on database testing is a long-term investment which leads to long-term stability and robustness of the application. Thus expenditure on Database Testing or SQL Testing is necessary.

Postman is a scalable API testing tool that quickly integrates into CI/CD pipeline. It started in 2012 as a side project by Abhinav Asthana to simplify API workflow in testing and development. API stands for Application Programming Interface which allows software applications to communicate with each other via API calls.
With over 4 million users nowadays, Postman Software has become a tool of choice for the following reasons:
Below is the Postman Workspace. Let’s explore the step by step process on How to use Postman and different features of the Postman tool!
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1899" height="663" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto7.png" alt="How To Use Postman To Execute APIs">
Get requests are used to retrieve information from the given URL. There will be no changes done to the endpoint.
We will use the following URL for all examples in this Postman tutorial https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users	
In the workspace
<img decoding="async" width="989" height="740" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto8.png" alt="Working with Get Requests">
*Note: There may be cases that Get Postman request may be unsuccessful. It can be due to an invalid request URL or authentication is needed.
Post requests are different from  Get request as there is data manipulation with the user adding data to the endpoint. Using the same data from the previous tutorial in Get request, let’s now add our own user.
Step 1) Click a new tab to create a new request.
<img decoding="async" width="398" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto9.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 2) In the new tab
<img decoding="async" width="632" height="259" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto10.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 3) In Body,
<img decoding="async" width="554" height="301" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto11.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Step 4) Copy and paste just one user result from the previous get request like below. Ensure that the code has been copied correctly with paired curly braces and brackets. Change id to 11 and name to any desired name. You can also change other details like the address.
<img decoding="async" width="603" height="518" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto12.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
*Note: Online Post request should have the correct format to ensure that requested data will be created. It is a good practice to use Get first to check the JSON format of the request. You can use tools like https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
<img decoding="async" width="1393" height="564" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto13.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
				Step 5)  Next,
<img decoding="async" width="864" height="536" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto14.png" alt="Working With Post Requests">
Data Parameterization is one of the most useful features of Postman. Instead of creating the same requests with different data, you can use variables with parameters. These data can be from a data file or an environment variable. Parameterization helps to avoid repetition of the same tests and iterations can be used for automation testing.
Parameters are created through the use of double curly brackets: {{sample}}. Let’s take a look at an example of using parameters in our previous request:
<img decoding="async" width="783" height="610" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto15.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
			Now let’s create a parameterize get request.
Step 1) 
There should be no response since we have not set the source of our parameter.
<img decoding="async" width="991" height="446" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto16.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">

<img decoding="async" width="720" height="575" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto19.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
Step 5) Go back to your Get request then click send. There should now be results for your request.
<img decoding="async" width="1197" height="816" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto20.png" alt="Parameterize Requests">
*Note: Always ensure that your parameters have a source such as an environment variable or data file to avoid errors.
Postman Tests are JavaScript codes added to requests that help you verify results such as successful or failed status, comparison of expected results, etc. It usually starts with pm.test. It can be compared to asserts, verify commands available in other tools.
Let’s do some basic API testing using Postman for our parameterize requests from the previous lesson.
Step 1) Go to your GET user request from the previous tutorial.
The pane is auto-populated
<img decoding="async" width="1190" height="605" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto21.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 2) Now click Send. The test result should now be displayed.
<img decoding="async" width="1195" height="620" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto22.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 3) Go back to the test tab and let’s add another test. This time we will compare the expected result to the actual result.
From the snippets section, click on “Response body:JSON value check”. We will be checking if Leanne Graham has the userid 1.
<img decoding="async" width="853" height="349" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto23.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 4)
<img decoding="async" width="525" height="163" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto24.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
Step 5) Click send. There should now be two passed test results for your request.
<img decoding="async" width="1537" height="680" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto25.png" alt="Create Postman Tests">
*Note: There are different kind of tests that can be created in Postman. Try to explore the tool and see what tests will fit your needs.
Collections play an important role in organizing test suites. It can be imported and exported making it easy to share collections amongst the team. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create and execute a collection.
Let’s start in creating a collection:
Step 1) Click on the New button at the top left corner of the page.
<img decoding="async" width="227" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto26.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 2) Select Collection. Create collection window should pop up.
<img decoding="async" width="1030" height="887" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto27.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 3) Input the desired collection name and description then click create. A collection should now be created.
<img decoding="async" width="932" height="468" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto28.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 4) Go back to the previous Get request. Click Save
<img decoding="async" width="439" height="101" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto29.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 5)
<img decoding="async" width="476" height="602" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto30.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 6)  Postman test collection should now contain one request.
<img decoding="async" width="548" height="553" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto31.png" alt="Create Collections">
Step 7) Repeat steps 4-5 for the previous Post request so that collection will now have two requests.
<img decoding="async" width="357" height="302" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto32.png" alt="Create Collections">
There are two ways to run a collection which is the Collection Runner and Newman. Let’s begin by executing the collection in Collection Runner.
Step 1) Click on the Runner button found at the top of the page next to the Import button.
<img decoding="async" width="828" height="329" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto33.png" alt="Run Collections Using Collection Runner">
Step 2) Collection Runner page should appear such as below. Following is the description of various fields
<img decoding="async" width="1143" height="912" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto34.png" alt="Run Collections Using Collection Runner">
Step 3) Run your Postman Test Collection by setting up the following:
<img decoding="async" width="850" height="915" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto35.png" alt="Run Collections Using Collection Runner">
Step 4)  Run Results page should be displayed after clicking the Run button. Depending on the delay, you should see the tests as they execute.
<img decoding="async" width="1244" height="762" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto36.png" alt="Run Collections Using Collection Runner">
You can see how important it is that there are tests in your requests so that you can verify HTTP request status if successful and the data is created or retrieved.
Another way to run a collection is via Newman. The main differences between Newman and Collection Runner are the following:
To install Newman and run our collection from it, do the following:
Step 1) Install nodejs using this link: http://nodejs.org/download/
Step 2) Open the command line and enter
Newman should now be installed on your computer.
<img decoding="async" width="950" height="181" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto37.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 3) Once Newman has been installed, let’s go back to our Postman workspace.In the Collections box, click on the three dots. Options should now appear. Select Export.
<img decoding="async" width="377" height="752" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto38.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 4) Choose Export Collection as Collection v2.1 (Recommended) then click Export.
<img decoding="async" width="583" height="370" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto39.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 5) Select your desired location then click Save. It is advisable to create a specific folder for your Postman tests. A collection should now be exported to your chosen local directory.
Step 6) We will also need to export our environment. Click on the eye icon beside the environment dropdown in Global, select Download as JSON. Select your desired location then click Save. It is advisable that the environment should be in the same folder as your collection.
<img decoding="async" width="889" height="654" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto40.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">
Step 7) Environment should now be exported to the same local directory as Collection.
Step 8) Now go back to command line and change the directory to where you have saved the collection and environment.
Step 9) Run your collection using this command:
Run results should now appear such as below.
<img decoding="async" width="875" height="483" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/011119_1057_PostmanTuto41.png" alt="Run Collections Using Newman">

<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira-testing-tool.png" alt="JIRA Testing Tool" width="750" height="250" />
JIRA is a tool developed by the Australian Company Atlassian. This software is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The JIRA full form is actually inherited from the Japanese word “Gojira” which means “Godzilla”. The basic use of this tool is to track issues and bugs related to your software and Mobile apps.
It is also used for project management. The JIRA dashboard consists of many useful functions and features that make handling of issues easy. Some of the key features are listed below. Now in these Jira tutorials, let’s learn JIRA Defect and Project tracking software with this Training Course.
Jira software can be used for the following purposes:
Here is a step by step process on how to use Jira software:
Below are 7 different teams that leverage JIRA to achieve their goals.
I use Tricentis Test Management for Jira as my test management solution. It allows me to handle all planning, tracking, and reporting directly within Jira.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/test-management-jira-logo.png" alt="Tricentis Test Management for Jira" width="330" height="62" />
It has an intuitive UI and uses Jira issues to define requirements and test cases, ensuring that QA and development share visibility into a single testing record. Unlike many of today’s Jira extensions, Test Management for Jira is low-cost and stays fast and performant as your team and projects grow, so you can scale without worry. Available for Jira Cloud.

Inside JIRA scheme, everything can be configured, and it consists of
This section in this Jira tutorial for beginners will guide you through JIRA Software Issues and their types.
JIRA issue would track bug or issues that underlies the project. Once you have imported the project then, you can create issues.
Under Issues, you will find other useful features like
Now, in this Jira Agile tutorial, let us see JIRA Issue in detail:
Issue Type displays all types of items that can be created and tracked via the Jira testing tool. JIRA Issues are classified under various forms, such as new feature, sub-task, bug, etc., as shown in the screenshot.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA1.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="752" height="441" />
There are two types of Issue types schemes in Jira project management tool:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA2.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="611" height="392" />
Apart from these two issue type schemes, you can also add schemes manually as per requirement, for example, we have created an IT & Support scheme, and for these, we will drag and drop the issue types from the Available Issue type to the Issue type for the current scheme as shown in the screen shot below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA3.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Types" width="752" height="368" />
Jira Components are sub-sections of a project; they are used to group issues within a project into smaller parts. Components add some structures to the projects, breaking it up into features, teams, modules, subprojects and more. Using components you can generate reports, collect statistics, and display it on dashboards and so on.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA4.jpg" alt="JIRA Components" width="752" height="210" />
To add new components, as shown in the above screen, you can add a name, description, component lead, and default assignee. 
When the issue is created in JIRA, it will be arranged and represented into different fields; this display of the fields in JIRA is known as a screen. This field can be transitioned and edited through workflow. For each issue, you can assign the screen type as shown in the screenshot. To add or associate an issue operation with a screen, you have to go to the main menu click on Issues click on Screen Schemes, and then click on “Associate an issue operation with a screen,” and add the screen according to the requirement. In this Jira tutorials for testers, we will learn about Jira Issue Attributes.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA5.jpg" alt="JIRA Screen" width="544" height="235" />
Issue Attributes encompasses:
Statuses: Different statuses are used to indicate the progress of a project like To do, InProgress, Open, Closed, ReOpened, and Resolved. Likewise, you have resolutions and priorities, in resolution it again tells about the progress of issue like Fixed, Won’t fix, Duplicate, Incomplete, Cannot reproduce, Done also you can set the priorities of the issue whether an issue is critical, major, minor, blocker and Trivial.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA6.jpg" alt="Jira Issue Attributes" width="752" height="437" />
This function in JIRA allows you to control who can view the issues. It consists of a number of security levels which can have users or groups assigned to them. You can specify the level of security for the issues while creating or editing an issue.
Similarly, there is a Default Permission Scheme. Any new project that is created will be assigned to this scheme. Permission Schemes allow you to create a set of permissions and apply this set-of-permissions to any project.
Some of the useful features that JIRA admin provides to users are:
Under Audit Log, you can view all the details about the issue created and the changes made in the issues.
This will show whether your issues link with any other issue that is already present or created in the project also you can de-activate Issue linking from the panel itself.
Using the Mail system in admin, you can mail issues to an account on a POP or IMAP mail server or messages written to the file system generated by an external mail service.
An event describes the status, the default template, and the notification scheme and workflow transition post-function associations for the event. The events are classified in two a System event (JIRA defined events) and Custom event (User defined events).
JIRA allows you to watch a particular issue, which informs you about notifications of any updates relating to that issue. To watch an issue, click on the word “watch” in the issue window. To see who is watching your issues, click on the number in brackets.
In the form of JIRA issues, an issue collector allows you to gather feedback on any website. In administration, if you click on Issue Collectors, an option will open asking to Add an Issue Collector. Once you have configured the look and feel of an Issue Collector, embed the generated JavaScript in any website for feedback.
You can also connect your Software development tools, including the Jira testing tool, to JIRA using this admin function. You have to enter the URL of the application to connect with JIRA.
I will guide you through the step-by-step process I use to create, edit, and summarize an issue in JIRA, an effective tool for testing.
Step 1) Open Jira software and login with your ID and password.
JIRA Dashboard will open when you enter your user ID and password. Under the free JIRA dashboard, you will find the option Project; when you click on it, it will open a window that lists options like Simple Issue Tracking, Project Management, Agile Kanban, Jira Classic, and so on, as shown in the screenshot below.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA7.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="653" height="299" />
Step 2) Provide issue details.
When you click on the option Simple Issue Tracking, another window will open, where you can mention all the details about the issue and assign the issue to the responsible person.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA8.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="327" />
Step 3) Provide detailed information to create an issue.
When you click on the “Submit” button, a window will open where you can perform a list of work like creating issues, assigning issues, checking the status of issues like- resolved, In-Progress or closed, and so on.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA9.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="725" height="433" />
Once the issue is created, a pop-up will appear on your screen saying your issue has been created successfully, as shown in the screenshot below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA10.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="64" />
Step 4) Open the Issues menu to search and perform multiple functions on issues.
Now, if you want to edit an issue or you want to export the issue to an XML or Word document, then you can hover your mouse on the main panel and click on Issues. Under Issues options, click on Search for issues, which will open a window from where you can locate your issues and perform multiple functions.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA11.png" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="602" height="286" />
When you select the “search for Issues” under Issues, a window will appear as shown in the screen shot:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA12.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="752" height="418" />
In the same window, you can set a filter for the issue and save it under Favorite Filters, so when you want to search or view a particular issue, you can locate it using the filter.
Step 5) Click on the Summary option to view the details about issues
To view the summary of the issue, you can click on options summary; this will open a window that will show all the details of your project and progress on this chart. On the right-hand side of the summary window, there is an Activity Stream, which gives the details about the issues and comments made by the assignee on the issue.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA13.jpg" alt="Create an issue in JIRA" width="787" height="429" />
Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into several smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do.
Sub-Task can be created in two ways:
To create a subtask in JIRA, you have to select an issue to which you want to assign the subtask. Under the issue window, click on the Assign more option, and then click on create subtask, as shown in the screenshot below. You can also select convert to subtask under the same tab to convert the parent issue into a subtask.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA14.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="752" height="437" />
Once you click Create Sub-Task, a window will pop up to add a sub-task issue. Fill up the details about the sub-task and click on Create as shown in below screen-shot, and this will create sub-task for the parent issue.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA15.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="625" height="441" />
It will create a sub-task under parent issues, and details will appear about when to complete the task on the issue type page,, as shown in the screenshot below. If you want to add more sub-tasks, you can click on the plus (+) sign in the corner of the sub-task panel. Likewise, if you want to note the time spent on the present task, click on the (+) plus sign in the corner of the time tracking and put down the details in the log sheet.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA16.jpg" alt="Create Sub-Task" width="706" height="150" />
Some important points to remember while creating Sub-Task:
A JIRA workflow is a set of statuses and transitions an issue undergoes during its lifecycle. Once the issue is created, the workflow encompasses five main stages.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA21.png" alt="WorkFlows" width="534" height="315" />
Workflow in JIRA comprises statutes, assignees, resolutions, conditions, validators, post-functions, and properties.
You can assign the issue’s status from the window itself when you click on the check box for IN Progress status, as shown in the screenshot below. The status will be reflected in the issue panel highlighted in yellow.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA22.png" alt="WorkFlows" width="602" height="281" />
For the issue we have created, JIRA will present a workflow that maps the project’s progress. As shown in screenshot whatever status that we have set in the Issue panel it will be reflected in Workflow chart, here we have set the issue status in “In Progress” and same status is updated in the workflow, highlighted in yellow. Workflow can give a quick overview of the work under process.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA23.jpg" alt="WorkFlows" width="707" height="369" />
There are plug-ins available for JIRA to work more effectively, some of these plugins are Zendesk, Salesforce, GitHub, Gitbucket, etc. Some of them enable the support team to report issues directly to JIRA, create unlimited private repositories with the full-featured issue and test management support, etc.
The Agile or Scrum method is generally used by development teams who follow a roadmap of planned features for upcoming versions of their product. Agile follows the same roadmaps to track their issues as in other JIRA methods To do -> In Progress -> Done, as shown in the screen shot below, we have one issue in To do and the second in In Progress. Once the issue in In Progress is resolved, it will move to Done status, and in the same way, the issue in To Do will move to the next stage, In Progress.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA24.png" alt="JIRA Agile" width="602" height="196" />
To create an Agile issue, go to the main menu under the Agile tab and click on “Getting Started.” when you click on it, it will ask you to create a new board for the issues for Scrum or Kanban. You can choose your option as per your requirement, here we have selected Scrum method.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA25.jpg" alt="Creating Issue in Agile" width="752" height="282" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA26.jpg" alt="Create an Epic in Agile" width="752" height="297" />
In JIRA Agile, an epic is simply an issue type. The epic captures a large body of work. It is a large user story that can be broken down into several small stories. To complete Jira Epic, it may take several sprints. You can either create a new epic in Agile or use the issue you have created in a normal JIRA board. Likewise, you can also create a story for agile scrum.
Plan Mode in Agile:
Plan mode displays all the user stories created for the project. You can use the left-hand side menu to decide the basis on which the issues must be displayed. While on the right-hand side menu clicking on the issue, you can create subtasks, logwork, etc.
Work Mode in Agile
It will display the active sprint information. All the issues or user stories will be displayed in three categories, as shown in the screenshot below: To do, In Progress, and Done, to show the progress of the project or issues.
In JIRA, you can also clone the issue; one advantage of cloning an issue is that the different teams can work separately on the issue and resolve the issue quickly.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA27.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="752" height="508" />
There is another useful function is JIRA Link, Issue linking allows you to create an association between two existing issues on either the same or different JIRA servers. As shown in the screenshot, we have linked the current issue, “ST-6 Drop down menu is not working,” with another issue, ” ST-4 GUI is not responsive- retest GUI functions”.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA28.png" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="593" height="276" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA29.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="771" height="326" />
Like here, we have set sprint for 1 day, and it will run sprint for that specific time period as shown in the screenshot below. If you are working with Scrum and want to prioritize the issue or rank the issue, then you just have to drag and drop the issue into the backlog.
Apart from this, there are multiple tasks that you can do; for instance, if you click on the right side corner of the window, a list of functions will pop up, that you can use as per your need.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA30.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="774" height="403" />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA31.jpg" alt="Use of Clone and Link in JIRA" width="752" height="219" />
To track the progress in Agile, a Burndown Chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be done in the sprint. A typical burndown chart will look somewhat like this, where the red line indicates the actual task remaining while the blue line indicates the ideal task remaining during the scrum cycle.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA32.png" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="602" height="246" />
Apart from the burn-down chart, there are other options available in JIRA automation like Sprint Report, Epic Report, Version Report, Velocity Chart, Control Chart, and Cumulative flow diagram. You can also use different chart options to represent the progress of your project.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA33.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="623" height="381" />
Like the screen shot above, we have selected a pie chart for issue priorities. It will generate a Pie Chart representing the priorities and severity of the issues in percentage for the whole project,, as shown below. You can view the pie chart from different perspectives like Assignee, Components, Issue Type, Priority, Resolution, Status, etc.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA34.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="572" height="389" />
You can also configure how you want to see the scrum board. Scrum board gives various options through which you can make changes into your board appearance. Various features you can configure using Scrum are Columns, Swimlanes, Quick Filters, Card colors, and so on. Here, we have selected column management and selected the option Issue count, and it will show the total number of issues in progress, to do, or done. In column management, we can add an additional column as per our requirement likewise there are different features you can configure on the board.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA35.jpg" alt="Reports in JIRA" width="752" height="389" />
Filters
You can also set filters other than default filters to filter the issues. The filters that you can use are date, component, priority, resolution, and so on.

Like Agile Scrum board, we can also create a Kanban Board, here we have created a project name Cloud Testing. Kanban board is useful for the team that manages and constrains their work in progress. Kanban boards are visible in Work mode but not in Plan mode.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA37.jpg" alt="Kanban Board and Managing Issues" width="752" height="298" />
Here we have created an issue ” Bug detected while load testing” and “Check issues related to cloud server” in Kanban Board as shown in the screenshot below, it also shows their status as highlighted in red.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/jira/111014_0555_JIRA38.jpg" alt="Kanban Board and Managing Issues" width="765" height="255" />
Kanban is considered the best methodology for bug fixing and maintenance release, where incoming tasks are prioritized and then worked accordingly. There are a few measures that can make Kanban more efficient.
From my experience, I can highlight the significant contrasts between JIRA Scrum and JIRA Kanban.
Burndown Chart: The chart shows all the changes and scope changed while the sprint is still on, other charts include Sprint Report, Velocity Chart, Epic Report, etc.
Control Chart: It allows you to measure the cycle time for issues, showing the mean time and actual time taken to complete issues.
It allows the team to see the progress of sprints. This is the work mode, where you can see the board itself broken down into different statuses.
The team can decide whether to increase or decrease the number of issues that should be displayed in each status.
This is where the team will plan sprints and estimate stories going into each sprint.
You can map columns to the statuses of your workflow. Simply by adding or removing columns, the workflow can be changed when required.

SAP PI (Process Integration) is an enterprise integration platform that provides seamless integration between SAP and non-SAP applications within the organization A2A (Application to Application) or even outside the organization B2B (Business to Business). It allows organizations to exchange information between internal softwares within the company and external systems outside the company.
The SAP PI full form is Process Integration.
SAP PO (Process Orchestration) is a tool for automation and optimization of business processes. It combines features of SAP Business Process Management (BPM), SAP Process Integration (PI), and SAP Business Rules Management (BRM). In other words, SAP Process Orchestration is a more advanced version of SAP PI and has all the tools required to integrate applications.
The SAP PO full form is Process Orchestration.
But this was a technical aspect of SAP PI, but to understand this better we will see the example of implementation of SAP Process Integration.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="630" height="418" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/11-2014/112814_0608_SAPPIProces1.png" alt="Understanding SAP PI/PO with an Example">
To understand the concept of SAP PI more clearly, we take an example of a large-scale Dairy Industry, which is operating in a large portion of a state and dominating the region. But there is some small-scale dairy industries operating in the same region, parallel to the large-scale industry which is not making a profit due to their price variation compare to large-scale industry. So to avoid the pricing conflict and maintaining the same price all over the region, large scale and small scale industry decide to link together, with the help of SAP PI. They interconnect with each other with the help of SAP PI and started to work as a single unit. Now, through SAP PI they are able to exchange all the information pertaining to dairy industry, including pricing and share an equal amount of profit.
SAP PI connects different platforms like 
Prior to SAP PI, business would connect with each other through point-to-point communication. But this process is not used for multiple and complex processes. For smooth communication between multiple businesses, Mediated communication or Integration broker is used, and SAP PI adapts this system very well. It enables interconnection of a different process via a central location known as Integration Broker, unlike the point to point connection which is more like a spider web. The integration broker or server is an integral part of mediated communication consist of Java based Advanced Adapter Engine (AAE) and an integration engine for routing. Mediated communication is based on an integration broker which is executed by exchanging XML messages.
Let see how SAP PI handles the XML messages by the help of Integration Broker. The exchange of data or message in SAP PI occurs in this four phases.
Next in this SAP PI tutorial, we will learn How SAP PI/PO works.
SAP PI performs three basic functions
Next in this SAP PO tutorial, we will learn about SAP PI PO architecture.

SAP PI is not a single component responsible for the integration of SAP and Non- SAP application, but it is a cluster of components that together make SAP PI functional. This architecture of SAP PI or components is used during design time, configuration time and at run time. The various components of SAP PI include
It is a central information provider in a system landscape. SLD contains two types of information, “Component Information (Installable & Installed) and Landscape description.”
It is a tool-set which contains a set of tools for accessing and editing integration objects
To develop, design and maintain data types, message structures, mappings, interfaces, integration processes and integration scenarios independently of system landscape, integration repository is used.
It is a central processing engine of the PI. All messages are processed using this server.
With the help of this monitoring of PI domain is done, and “workbench” is the tool that is used for monitoring.
It acts as a connector to connect the integration engine to SAP systems and other systems.
To access data from SAP and Non-SAP application this technique is used. SAP PI uses an intermediate document like IDoc to Flat files to transfer their data.
Process Integration (PI) uses integration repository to design message structure
Integration Directory (ID) is used to configure technical parameters for objects created in IR ( Integration Repository)
Once the IDOC is activated in SAP system, PI takes in charge and convert messages into XML format for its internal processing
The messages can be monitored and traced using “Run Time Workbench”. This tool can be useful in monitoring sender and receiver adapters, Outgoing and Incoming messages, End to End monitoring of complete scenario and error traces.
SAP PI connects with any external systems (SAP or Non-SAP) using the Adapter Framework. The adapter framework is based on the AS Java runtime environment and the connector architecture (JCA) version. The adapter framework consists of two default module chains if message processing is to be executed entirely within the adapter, default module chain for the adapter can be used.
There are four types of Adapters used in SAP PI
Other interfaces supported by adapter framework are

For messages, SAP PI provides the message level security for XI message protocol, for the SOAP adapter, for the RosettaNet protocol, for mail adapter, for the CIDX protocol and for connectivity with WSRM (Web Service Reliable Messaging) enabled systems. In SAP PI message level security enabled through the use of encryption, digital signature, SAML Assertion, Username token, Certificate token, etc. Authentication methods supported by WS infrastructure for transport level includes basic authentication (Password and Username), SAP assertion ticket, and HTTP over SSL.
Connecting Integration Server with WSRM (Web Service Reliable Messaging) Enabled System
To connect with WSRM enabled system you use a communication channel of adapter type WS.
The new features in SAP PI include
When SAP PI/PO is not recommended in enterprise SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)

Let’s start this SAP APO Tutorial with introduction of SAP APO:
SAP APO is a key component of SAP to form a technical foundation for SAP modules. It is designed for high consistency in business processes, from order generation to production planning, and improving customer service while reducing costs.  It is used for SCM (Supply Chain Management) to plan and execute supply chain processes. SAP APO stands for Advanced Planner Optimizer.
It is also known as APS (Advance Planning and Scheduling) tool.
Another important function of SAP APO Module is the SCC (Supply Chain Cockpit), it provides users with a graphical instrument panel for controlling and managing the supply chain. Various department of a company uses SCC like demand planners, strategic planners and production planners.
Following are components of SAP APO

Let’s look into them in detail!
To run a successful business, market forecasting and planning is an important factor. “Demand Planning” is the art of understanding customers future demand and execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management.  SAP Demand Planning provides advanced forecasting and demand planning tools that help companies to identify changes in demand as early as possible. Marketing and promotion are also done by the forecast of market demand using SAP APO Demand Planning.
SNP (Supply Network Planning) integrates information on purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and transportation so that tactical planning and decision can be made and implemented based on a single consistent model. Based on heuristic and mathematical optimization methods, SAP APO SNP ensures that organization or company meets the demand and performs activities like transportation, production, and warehousing resources.
For instance, the deployment function determines how and when the inventory should be deployed to distribution centers or warehouse.
It allows manufacturing units to plan material and critical resources in an optimal fashion.  A frequent demand for manufacturing units is to produce with limited resources.
PP/DS helps to analyze the lead time and resources required for production.  You can reduce the inventory cost, increase on-time delivery performance, and reduce lead time for the product using SAP PPDS.
The purpose of “Global available-to-promise” is to determine whether the requested product by the customer would be available on given or promised date.  The process deals with improving, on-time delivery performance, planning system integration and sufficiently increasing stock to buffer inventories.
By opting for best and short route of transportation, a company can save time, money and fuel spent on transporting and delivering goods. TP/VS provides transportation planner and schedules the routes at lower transportation cost. It offers functions like shipment consolidation, route determination, carrier selection, multi-pick, and multi-drop, etc.
On manifesting positive outcome of SAP APO System for business process, SAP APO is enhanced with extra features like
Although SAP APO is no longer marketed as a separate solution, its functionality underlies SAP CRM, SAP E-Procurement, and SAP Supply Chain Management.  Because of its open architecture, it is open to future enhancement like model functionality, higher degrees of parallelization and improved optimization algorithms.

SAP HANA is the latest, in-memory database, and platform which can be deployed on-premises or cloud. SAP HANA is a combination of hardware and software, which integrates different components like SAP HANA Database, SAP SLT (System Landscape Transformation) Replication server, SAP HANA Direct Extractor connection, and Sybase replication.
HANA has unprecedented adoption by the SAP customers. SAP HANA is capable of processing a large amount of real time data in a short time period.
There are different types of SAP HANA edition, some of them as below-
The following diagram shows difference between all editions –
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="294" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/sap-hana/030116_1025_WhatisSAPHA1.png" alt="SAP HANA Training Tutorials for Beginners">
SAP HANA is a next-generation in-memory business platform. It accelerates analytics and application on a single and in-memory platform.


SAP HANA has many processes running on the SUSE Linux Server. SUSE Linux server manages the reservation of memory to all process.
When SAP HANA starts up, Linux OS reserves memory for the program code, program stack, and static data. OS can dynamically reserve additional data memory upon request from the SAP HANA Server.
SAP HANA create a memory pool for managing and tracking the consumption of memory. The memory pool is used to store all the in-memory data and system tables, thread stack, temporary computations and all other data structure required for managing the database.
<img decoding="async" width="573" height="452" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/sap-hana/030116_1025_WhatisSAPHA2.png" alt="SAP HANA">
When more memory is required for table growth or temporary computations, the SAP HANA memorymanager obtains this from the pool.
For an overview, check out the Memory Overview feature of the SAP HANA studio. To access it, right-click on a System ->Configuration and Monitoring -> Open Memory Overview in the context menu, as follows:

Below are advantages of SAP HANA –
Currently, SAP HANA also work as in-Memory database for SAP BW, so in this way SAP HANA able to improve the overall performance of SAP Net weaver BW.
SAP HANA Information composer is a web application that allows us to do modelling and upload local data to SAP HANA database.
This is Modelling environment for non-technical people like an end user. Information Composer works same as SAP HANA Modeler and used by Business user with less technical knowledge.
A Large amount of data (up to 5 million of cell) can be uploaded using Information Composer.
Role required for work with SAP HANA Information Composer –
SQL Expressions is a clause that can be used for return values. There are 4 types of SQL Expressions-
A trigger is also a stored procedure that automatically executes when an event happens on a given table or view.
The database users only having the TRIGGER privilege for the given <subject_table_name>  are allowed to create a trigger for that table or view.
The CREATE TRIGGER command defines a set of statements that are executed when a given operation (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) takes place on a given subject table or subject view.

Data profiling is the process of analyzing the data available in an existing data source and collecting statistics and information about that data.  SQL  DATA profiling task is used to understand and analyze data from different data source. By Data profiling process user can remove incorrect and incomplete data before loading to the data warehouse.
Advantage of SAP HANA SQL DATA Profiling is as below –

SAPUI5 is a set of libraries to build responsive web applications that run on multiple devices like Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet. SAPUI5 works on MVC concept to accelerate the development cycle by creating data, business logic, and representation of data separately on the view. So the development of view and controller can take place independently to create models (data containers).
SAPUI5 is the latest in the series of SAP UI development technologies. In order to provide web integration for the underlying SAP ERP system, SAP came up with multiple UI development technologies like BSP (Business server pages), PDK (Portal development kit), Web Dynpro Java, Web Dynpro ABAP. And the successor of Web Dynpro ABAP is SAPUI5.
In the above Architecture, first box, i.e. ‘Devices’ indicate the devices on which UI5 applications run. UI5 applications can be accessed via a Mobile app or any browser on these devices. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Presentation Layer.’
SAPUI5 applications and oData services reside on SAP NetWeaver Gateway Server. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Application Layer.’
Actual business logic is implemented in SAP core systems like ECC, CRM, and BW, etc.… Business logic can be implemented using SAP programs and function modules. SAP transactional and Master Data reside on SAP systems. This layer of the architecture is called ‘Database Layer’ or ‘Persistence Layer.’
A Component is a piece of working code that is reused wherever required. There are 2 types of components provided by SAPUI5
Essentially, a Component is a folder. When you create a new SAPUI5 application, you will be able to see a folder structure created in your project explorer like below.
<img decoding="async" width="360" height="223" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor2.png" alt="SAPUI5 Component">
In this UI5 application, PassNum is a Component. Component.js file is mandatory for UI5 application to behave like a Component. Component.js file is the component controller.
Next in this SAPUI5 Eclipse tutorial, we will learn how to setup SAPUI5.
Before we start, you need to ensure that –
After the application is completely built, it should look like below:
<img decoding="async" width="950" height="531" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor3.png" alt="SAPUI5 Setup">
In this SAPUI5 tutorials guide, we will create 2 components namely Parent Component and Child Component. First, we will create Child Component and then consume it in Parent component.
Let’s start getting our hands dirty.
Our goal is to create a Child Component that will accept a number from 1 to 12 and display the name of the month. For example, it receives 3; it should display ‘March’.
Go to File->New->Other->SAPUI5 Application Development->Application project.
<img decoding="async" width="672" height="460" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor4.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Create an application project for SAPUI5 by following the wizard that opens up. See screenshot below.
<img decoding="async" width="526" height="507" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor5.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Enter Name of the project, let the other selections remain the same as suggested by the wizard.
<img decoding="async" width="525" height="497" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor6.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
In the above screenshot, there are 2 types of libraries displayed as radio buttons
When you select sap.m, you are telling the wizard to create a UI5 application project whose bootstrap section will automatically include sap.m library which is meant for creating a responsive web application.
Next in this SAP FIORI tutorial, you will see below section of the wizard where you need to create initial View. An Initial view is a view which will be rendered first when the application is accessed.
<img decoding="async" width="509" height="661" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor7.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Here you need to give the name of the view and select type of the view. SAPUI5 supports 4 types of view as evident on the above screen. So the UI of a SAPUI5 application can be built using Javascript or XML or JSON or HTML whichever language you are comfortable with.
At the end of the wizard, a new project will be created and displayed on Project Explorer window of Eclipse like below.
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="229" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor8.png" alt="Create the UI Project">
Next, let us create a Component.js file and write below code in it.
Next, let us tell out the index.html file to load Component.js in SAPUI5 when the application is accessed from the browser. So write below code in the index.html file.
Next, let us write code in our displaymonth view which will display the Month whose month number is received from the parent Component.
After you’ve pasted above code, your view should look like below-
<img decoding="async" width="572" height="322" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor9.png" alt="DisplayMonthView.view.xml code">
And finally, let us write code of DisplayMonthView’s Controller file.
The code is written only in the onInit() hook method of this controller hence pasting here only the onInit() code. Rest of the file is as generated by the framework.
Deploy the project and give the technical name of the BSP application which will be generated on the ABAP frontend server. Let the name be zdisplaymonth. At this point, your application project should look like below.
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="251" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor10.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server">
Now it is the time to create a new Component (Parent Component) which will consume the Component we created so far in this tutorial.
Go to File->New->Other->SAPUI5 Application Development->Application project. Then follow wizard instructions to create new SAPUI5 application project. This has been described in detail in Step 1 of Part 1 in this tutorial above.
Name of the parent Component project is PassNum. And the technical name of the BSP application generated after deployment of SAPUI5 component to ABAP frontend server is zpassnum. The project structure will look like below
<img decoding="async" width="363" height="288" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor11.png" alt="Create a new SAPUI5 application">
Let us now write code in index.html, Component.js and PassNum.view.xml and PassNum.controller.js files
After you use above code in your view, your view should look like below
<img decoding="async" width="826" height="453" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor12.png" alt="Source code of PassNum.view.xml file">
Only the onInit() method has been changed. Everything else in this file remains the same
Deploy the application on ABAP frontend server and run it. You should be able to run it by right-clicking on the project and clicking ‘Run on ABAP server’ option.
<img decoding="async" width="635" height="597" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor13.png" alt="Deployment of Parent Component to SAP Netweaver Gateway Server">
Below URL will open up in eclipse browser.
http://hostname:8000/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zpassnum/index.html
Copy the URL and run it in the actual browser. In the above hostname marked in yellow is the hostname of your ABAP frontend server.
<img decoding="async" width="970" height="422" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor14.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server Output">
Click on ‘First’ button, January should display in the Child Component.
<img decoding="async" width="970" height="504" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0723_SAPUI5Tutor15.png" alt="SAP Netweaver Gateway Server Output">

Before we learn SAP BODS overview, let’s understand
ETL stands for Extract-Transform-Load, and it is a process of how data is loaded from the target system to the data warehouse. Data is extracted from a database and transformed to match according to the data warehouse schema. After that, it is loaded back to the data warehouse database in the form of dimension and fact tables.
SAP BODS is an ETL tool for extracting data from disparate systems, transform data into meaningful information, and load data in a data warehouse. It is designed to deliver enterprise-class solutions for data integration, data quality, data processing and data profiling. The full form of SAP BODS is Business Objects Data Services.
Here, are famous landmarks in the history of SAP BODS:
Here, are some basic components of SAP BODS architecture:
A repository is a set of a table which holds user-created and predefined system object, source, target metadata, and transformation rules. It allows you to set up repositories on an open client/server platform. This helps you for sharing metadata with other enterprise tools. Each local repository is connected with one or more job server which runs the job you have created.
SAP BOD Data Services Management Console is the web-based application with the following features.
The Job Server component helps you to starts the data movement engine. It allows you to integrate data from multiple sources. It helps you to perform complex data transformations and manages transactions and extractions from ERP systems and other sources.
The Data integration Job server tool allows you to move in data in either batch or real-time mode. It delivers high data throughput and scalability. Moreover, while designing a job, you can also run it from the Designer which tells the Job Server to run the job. The Job Server also allows you to get the job from its associated BODS SAP repository.
The Data services Designer tool offers an easy-to-use graphical user interface that helps you define transformations, data mappings, and control logic.
This component helps you to build applications containing data and workflows. This component also allows you to manage metadata stored in a repository.
After SAP BusinessObjects Data Services job are executed, the Job Server starts the engine to perform data extraction, transformation, and movement. The engine uses parallel processing and in-memory data transformation to offer high data connectivity, quality, and scalability.
Access server offers real time request-reply message that collects message request routes them to a real-time service and delivers a message reply in a specific duration. The Acess Server queries message and sends them to the next available real-time service across numerous computing resources.
The next component is the Address Server. It offers address validation and corrections. The Address Server must be started before processing data flows which contain the Global address Cleanse or Global Suggestion list transform with the EMEA engine enabled.
A Datastore offers a connection to a data source like a database. It is a linking interface between the actual backend database and Data services. Data store also allows data services to import the description of the data source such as metadata.
CMC is a web-based administration tool for BOD. It is a helpful tool to perform some essential functions like repository registration, user management, etc.
Data Integrator web administrator is also known as DI web admin. It helps you to maintain repositories in Data services. This SAP BOD services included in DI web admin are Meta Repository, Central Repository, job services, and web services.
Here are a few pros of BODS in SAP
Here, are few draws backs of using SAP BODS.

In this SAP Security tutorial for beginners, we will learn about SAP Security basic concepts.
SAP Security is a balancing act for protecting the SAP data and applications from unauthorized use and access. SAP offers different tools, processes and measures for security check to protect these data. SAP security helps to ensure that users can only use the functionality of SAP which is a part of their job.
SAP Systems contain very sensitive and confidential data of their clientele and businesses. Hence, there is a need for a regular audit of an SAP computer system to check its security and data integrity.
For instance, an employee in a warehouse who is responsible for creating a purchase order shall not approve a rightful purchase order or otherwise he may create and approve as many purchase order without any use.
In such scenario, the purchase order approval should be controlled by a higher authority which is a standard security feature.
Next in this SAP Security for beginners tutorial, we will learn about various Security concepts in SAP.
Below are the main Security Concepts in SAP:
Transaction codes are the front door to get the access to SAP’s functionality. STAD data provide security against unauthorized transaction access. Does it keep a record of information like who accessed certain critical functionality? And when? STAD data can be used to monitor, analyze, audit and maintain the security concept.
SAP Cryptographic Library is the default encryption product delivery by SAP. It is used for providing Secure Network Communication (SNC) between various SAP server components. For front-end components, you need to buy an SNC certified partner product.
To make SAP system application available for access from a web browser, a middleware component called Internet Transaction Server (ITS) is used. The ITS architecture has many built-in security features, such as to run the Wgate and Agate on separate hosts.
The basic security tools that SAP uses are Firewalls & DMZ, Network Ports, SAPRouter, etc. A firewall is a system of software and hardware components which define the connections that should pass back and forth between communication partners. SAP Web dispatcher and SAPRouter are examples of application level gateways that you can use for filtering SAP network traffic.
SSL (Secure Socket Layer), is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and client.  With SSL you can authenticate the communication partners(server & client), by determining the variables of the encryption.
With sap cyber security, both partners are authenticated. The data transferred between the server and client will be protected so any manipulation in the data will be detected. In addition to that data transferred between the client and server is also encrypted. Enterprise portal security guide can be helpful to secure the system by following their guidelines.
The SAP single sign-on function enables you to configure same user credentials to access multiple SAP systems.  It helps to reduce administrative costs and security risk associated with maintaining multiple user credentials.  It ensures confidentiality through encryption during data transmission.
AIS or Audit Information System is an auditing tool that you can use to analyze security aspects of your SAP system in detail. AIS is designed for business audits and systems audits. AI presents its information in the Audit InfoStructure.
Next in this SAP Security tutorial, we will learn about SAP security for mobile apps.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="268" height="387" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/blog/sap_security_2.jpg" alt="SAP Security for Mobile SAP Apps">
SAP applications are now available on mobile with an increase in the mobile users. But this exposure is a potential threat. The biggest threat for an SAP app is the risk of an employee losing important data of customers.
The good thing about mobile SAP is that most mobile devices are enabled with remote wipe capabilities.  And many of the CRM- related functions that organizations are looking to mobilize are cloud-based, which means the confidential data does not reside on the device itself.
Some of the popular mobile SAP security providers are SAP Afaria, SAP Netweaver Gateway, SAP Mobile Academy and SAP Hana cloud.

There are two platforms in SAP BPC finance. About 80% of its functionality is same except the difference in the back-end. In each platform, there is two version.
Like any other module, SAP BPC module too holds master and transaction data. BPC in SAP is divided into two components namely “Administration” and “Reporting“.
For any organization to run a business successfully financial planning, budgeting, and forecasting are important attributes. SAP BPC software provide everything in one package.
Let’s see each attribute of SAP BPC in detail,
It helps management team to formulate its vision, mission, core values, and objectives. The team develops strategic plans to uphold its competitive advantage in the marketplace. It helps them to answer the following questions.
It is not just a prediction of future results. It is also a plan of actions and expected operations of the organization over the next year. Budgeting is done for proactive management and measurement of corporate performance.
It ensures performance progress is monitored, problems are anticipated, and continuous improvement efforts are promoted.
It is the act of predicting outcomes. It is done throughout the year to reflect changes that have occurred both in the internal and external environment. It determines how the internal or external environment impact on the original plans and budgets? The main objective is to provide more accurate information for less risk management planning and decision making.
The EPM solution use is widening over the financial divisions. It is similar to CPM (Corporate Performance Management), BPM( Business Performance Management) and FPM (Finance Performance Management). EPM is being used as a unique repository to manage relevant information.
SAP BPC Architecture. It uses various business rules and script logics for doing the planning. The key components in BPC architecture are shown in the image below.
BPC Administration allows administrators to perform maintenance and setup tasks for BPC client applications.
BPC financial administration has two interfaces; a client application and a web interface. The administration action pane lists the available tasks for both interfaces

The console client is a Microsoft explorer-like window. Where we manage items such as application sets, applications, business rules, dimensions and business process flows. The browser client allows to control application set and application properties, as well as maintain BPC web parameters.
Dimensions represent the entities of a business (e.g., accounts, company codes, and categories). They represent the master, text, and hierarchy data for each of the business entities.
It is possible to create new dimensions in a BPC application set. There is no restriction to create a number of dimensions in SAP BPC. These dimensions then become shared dimensions that are available for use in any application within the appset.
Some dimensions are required dimensions. It must exist in all the applications within an application set. While the dimension type determines the default properties to be included in the dimension. It is possible to add additional properties as needed.
Required in each application
Required in each application set
Needed to validate currencies that are input in Entity type dimension. This may not be part of any applications within the application set
It is also possible to create additional dimensions as a requirement
Un = User defined dimension type. For each user-defined dimension, the number ‘n’ will be incremented. For e.g; U1, U2, U3 and so on
Select Dimension Library on the left side. The action pane will display the related dimension tasks.

Apache is a remarkable piece of application software.  It is the most widely used Web Server application in the world with more than 50% share in the commercial web server market. Apache is the most widely used Web Server application in Unix-like operating systems but can be used on almost all platforms such as Windows, OS X, OS/2, etc. The word, Apache, has been taken from the name of the Native American tribe ‘Apache’, famous for its skills in warfare and strategy making.
It is a modular, process-based web server application that creates a new thread with each simultaneous connection. It supports a number of features; many of them are compiled as separate modules and extend its core functionality, and can provide everything from server side programming language support to authentication mechanism. Virtual hosting is one such feature that allows a single Apache Web Server to serve a number of different websites.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="564" height="385" alt="Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache1_1.jpg">
There are numerous ways of installing the package or application.  There are enlisted below –
The apache web server is a modular application where the administrator can choose the required functionality and install different modules as per his/her requirement.
All modules can be compiled as a Dynamic Shared Objects (DSO is an object file that could be shared by multiple apps while they are executing) that exists separately from the main apache file.  The DSO approach is highly recommended, it makes the task of adding/removing/updating modules from the servers configuration very simple.
On Red Hat or rpm based systems
If you are using an rpm (RedHat Package Manager is a utility for installing application on Linux systems) based Linux distribution i.e. Red Hat, Fedora, CentOs, Suse, you can install this application by either vendor specific Package Manager or directly building the rpm file from the available source tarball.
You can install Apache via the default Package Manager available on all Red Hat based distributions like CentOs, Red Hat and Fedora.
The apache source tarball could be converted into an rpm file using the following command.
It is mandatory to have -devel package installed on your server for creating .rpm file from source.
Once you convert the source file into an rpm installer, you could use the following command to install Apache.
After the installation the server does not start automatically, in order to start the service, you have to use any of the following command on Fedora, CentOs or Red Hat.
Installing apache from the source require the –devel package to be installed on your server. .You can find the latest available version of Apache, you can download it here .  Once you download the source file move it to the /usr/local/src folder.
In order to see all configuration option available for Apache, you can use ./configure –help option.  The most common configuration option is –prefix={install directory name}.
The above example shows the compilation of Apache within the /usr/local/apache directory with the DSO capability. The –enable-so option, can load required modules to apache at run time via the DSO mechanism rather than requiring a recompilation.
Once the installation completes, you can browse the web servers default page with your favorite browser.  If firewall is enabled on your server, you must have to make exception for port 80 on your OS firewall.  You can use the following command to open port 80.
service iptables save
You can see the default Apache2 Welcome screen by browsing your server IP address.
<img decoding="async" width="1016" height="708" alt="Install Apache from Source" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache1_2.jpg">
An Apache web server can host multiple websites on the SAME server. You do not need separate server machine and apache software for each website. This can achieved using the concept of Virtual Host or VHost.
Any domain that you want to host on your web server will have a separate entry in apache configuration file.
<img decoding="async" width="518" height="397" alt="Virtual Host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_1.jpg">

Name based virtual hosting is used to host multiple virtual sites on a single IP address. 
<img decoding="async" width="550" height="283" alt="Name-based Virtual Host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_2.jpg">
In order to configure name based virtual hosting, you have to set the IP address on which you are going to receive the Apache requests for all the desired websites.  You can do this by NameVirutalHost directive within the apache configuration i.e. httpd.conf/apache2.conf file.

You can add as many virtual hosts, as per your requirement. You can check your web configuration files with:
If the configuration file has some wrong syntax, it will throw an error
In order to setup IP based virtual hosting, you need more than one IP address configured on your server.  So, the number of vhost apache will depend onnumber of IP address configured on your server.  If your server has 10 IP addresses, you can create 10 IP based virtual hosts.
<img decoding="async" width="545" height="275" alt="IP-based Virtual host" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache2_3.jpg">

In the above diagram two websites example1.com and example2.com were assigned different IPs and are using IP-based virtual hosting.

Running Php files on Apache needs mod_php enabled on your server.  It allows Apache to interpret .Php files.  It has Php handlers that interpret the Php code in apache and send HTML to your web server.
 If mod_php is enabled on your server, you will have a file named php.conf in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory.  You can also check it with:
The output will be similar to:
<img decoding="async" width="682" height="506" alt="What Apache needs to Run Php File" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache3_1.jpg">
mod_phpis the oldest PHP handler, it makes PHP part of apache and does not call any external PHP process. This module is installed by default in every Linux distribution repository, so enabling/disabling this module is very easy.
If you are using FastCGI as your PHP handler, you can set multiple versions of PHP to be used by different accounts on your server.
FastCGI i.e. mod_fastcgi is an extension of mod_fcgid, where as mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative of CGI i.e. mod_cgi . It starts sufficient number of instances of CGI to handle concurrent web requests.  It also uses suexec to support different users with their own instances of PHP and improves web security. 
Running ruby files on Apache needs mod_ruby to be enabled.  Apache can also handle ruby files through FastCGI.  It is possible to use multiple version of ruby with the help of mod_fcgid i.e. FastCGI.
You can also install apache passenger and configure Apache to use it for serving ruby pages.
(Phusion Passenger also known as “passenger” is a free web server module that is designed to integrate with Apache and Nginx )
Steps to install mod_ruby on your server –
We have to add the mod_ruby module to the Apache configuration i.e. /etc/httpd/conf.d/ruby.conf and add the following line.
LoadModule ruby_module modules/mod_ruby.so
If you like to enable or disable these modules, you have to edit the apache configuration file and comment or uncomment these modules, if the web server is already compiled with these modules.
<img decoding="async" width="676" height="486" alt="Run Ruby with Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache3_2.jpg">
Securing your web server is very important, it means allowing others to see only the intended information & protecting your data and restricting access.
These are common things that enhance your Apache web servers’ security.
Apache displays its version and the name of the operating system in errors as shown in below screenshot.
<img decoding="async" width="511" height="307" alt="Hiding Apache version and OS Information" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_1.jpg">
A hacker can use this information to launch an attack using the publicly available vulnerabilities in the particular version of the server or OS.
In order to prevent Apache webserverfromdisplaying this information, we have to modify
“server signature” option available in the apache configuration file.  By default, it is “on”, we need to set it “off”. 
We have also set “ServerTokens Prod” that tells the web server to return only apache and suppress the OS major and minor version
After modifying the configuration file, you have to restart/reload your apache web server to make it effective.
<img decoding="async" width="652" height="330" alt="Hiding Apache version and OS Information" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_2.jpg">
If your document root directory does not have an index file, by default your apache web server will show all the content of the document root directory.
<img decoding="async" width="407" height="459" alt="Disable Directory Listing" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_3.jpg">
This feature could be turn off for a specific directory through “options directive” available in the Apache configuration file.
<img decoding="async" width="404" height="306" alt="Disable Directory Listing" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_4.jpg">

It is good practice to disable all unnecessary modules that are not in use.  You can see list of enabled module available in your apache configuration file –
Many of the listed modules can be disabled likemod_imap, mod_include, mod_info, mod_userdir, mod_autoindex, as they are hardly used by any production web servers.
Once you commented the module, save the file.
Restart apache services with following command.
If you like to make sure that files that is outside the web root directory are not accessible, you have to make sure that the directory is restricted with “Allow” and “Deny option” in your web server configuration file.
Once you restrict acess outside the web root directoy, you will not be able to access any file located on any other folder on your web server, you will get 404 return code.
<img decoding="async" width="795" height="481" alt="Restricting Access to Files outside the Web Root Directory" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_5.jpg">
If you like to protect your web server from Dos (i.e. Denial of Service) you must enable the module mod_evasive.  It is a third party module that detects Dos attack and prevents the attack from doing as much damage as it would do if left to run its course. It could be downloaded here.
 Download the above File
This module works as a firewall for Apache and allows you to monitor traffic in real time.  It also prevents the web server from brute force attacks. The mod_security module could be installed with the default package manager of your distribution.
<img decoding="async" width="412" height="278" alt="Using mod_security to Enhance Apache Security" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache4_6.jpg">
Apache does not have any restriction on the total size of the http request that could lead to a DoS attack.  You can limit the request size of an Apache directive “LimitRequestBody” with the directory tag. The value could be set anything from 0 to 2 GB (i.e. 2147483647 bytes) as per your requirement.

Apache logs provide detailed information that help to detect common issues with server.
In order create access logs, mod_log_configmodule must be enabled.
TransferLog directive is available in the apache configuration file and it rotates virtual host log files as per set parameters.
You can enable them by editing the apache configuration file i.e. apache2.conf (Debian/ubuntu) or httpd.conf (rpm based systems) file
Common Log generated by Apache
Here,
Combined Log generated by Apache:
Custom Log creates separate log file for each Virtual Host on your server.  It needs to be specified in the virtual host section of the config file.
You can see below mentioned virtual host configuration, generated log will be custom for that virtual host and the format will be combined.
<img decoding="async" width="585" height="228" alt="Combined Log Generated by Apache" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache5_1.jpg">
1.  In order to have a running production web server, you need a dedicated node (Physical/Virtual or cloud instance) running Linux/Unix, Windows, MacOS etc. 
2.  The Web Server must have a direct network connection and a staticIP address configured on it.
3.  It needs to have all the modules required for running web pages.  If a web server processes PHP pages, it needs to have PHP  module enabled.
<img decoding="async" width="728" height="389" alt="Configure Production Web Sever" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/Network.png">
So, one can say that managing a web server for multiple domains is very complex task and requires editing hundreds of configuration file, customizing each application to fulfill the desired result.  Troubleshooting any miss configuration will be very difficult for beginners.
Cpanel provide a graphical way of managing your web server.  It is meant to provide mass hosting services that is easy to use and configure.  cPanel has reduced the technical barriers to entry into the hosting and web server management.  It makes complex task easier, it provides many useful and easy to use web interfaces that perform common system administration tasks required to operate a web server.
<img decoding="async" width="755" height="794" alt="The Solution using Cpanel or Similar Software" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/apache/Apache/apache6_2.jpg">
cPanel compiles its own version of software.
 If you have to recompile your web server i.e. apache on normal Linux platform, you have to manually select/search the module that is required.  cPanel provides Easyapache functionality that is a script based web server compilation method.

Kotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It combines Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) and functional programming in unrestricted, self-sufficient, and distinctive platforms. It also allows the twinning of functionalities by miniature codes. Kotlin is a general-purpose programming language which was designed by JetBrains.
Here, are important landmarks from the history of Kotlin:
Here, are some important reasons why Kotlin is used widely:
Here are a few features of the Kotlin that will make you sure of the progress path of the programming language.
Kotlin is an OOPs-based programming language where code line can be trimmed up to 40 % that which makes Kotlin an ideal choice for software or web development.
Kotlin for Android utilizes JVM and combines the features of OOPs and functional-oriented programming.
it is easy to compile the code when working with Kotlin that results in better performance for android development, and it will also explain which type of data function can be used in the entire code.
Kotlin can support a variety of extension functions without making any changes to the code. it helps in making existing code more appealing and magnificent for developers.
For Example:
This code will assist in trimming down the first and the last character of the string, we can apply it as:
In Kotlin, the system distinguishes between null references and not null references as shown in below Kotlin example.
For example, a String variable cannot hold null:
Kotlin code can be used by Java, and Java codes can be used with Kotlin. So, if you have knowledge about OOPs programming, it is easy to switch to Kotlin’s development. Also, if there are some applications written in Java, then they can be used with Kotlin’s environment.
Like Java, Kotlin code can also be written using IDE or using the command-line interface. It is easy to work with IDE, and syntax errors are also reduced dramatically. At the same time, when you are working with a command-line interface, code has to be compiled first.
Smart casting basically helps to cut down the application costs and improves its speed or performance. It works on managing the efficiency of code using type casting or immutable values.
For example, if the string is identified, then it’s length and count and can be found with the help of Smart Cast function:
Kotlin is preferred by enterprises because of its lost cost of adoption. Most importantly, it is easy to learn by developers, especially having a programming background.
Following are the steps which help you in setting up a working environment by installing Kotlin.
As we have discussed earlier that Kotlin is based on Java, so you have to install Java first when planning to adopt Kotlin. Refer our Java Installation Tutorial.
Luckily, there are multiple Java IDEs to choose from. Here we have given download links to make things a little easier for you.
In this Kotlin tutorial, we will use Eclipse.
For Installing Kotlin in Eclipse, go to the Help section in Eclipse and click the Eclipse Marketplace option.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="313" height="363" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor1.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Now, Type the Kotlin keyword into the search box. Click on Go option to list the plugin. It will give you a link of Kotlin plug-in, you need to install the plug-in from the given link.
<img decoding="async" width="575" height="406" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor2.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Please restart the Eclipse IDE, once the installation is complete. You can find a shortcut icon in the top right corner of Eclipse IDE. It is a quick access method.
<img decoding="async" width="242" height="93" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor3.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Another way of accessing Kotlin in Eclipse IDE is, go to the Windows, Perspectives, Open Perspectives, then choose Others option. Here, you can check a list of plugins installed later, as given below.
<img decoding="async" width="328" height="203" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor4.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Once, you have verified the Kotlin installation, let us create the first Kotlin program in the next step.
Start with your first Kotlin project. From the File menu, choose the New option, then select others and start with a new Kotlin project from the list.
<img decoding="async" width="519" height="146" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor5.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
Now, you have to define a name for the project, and you are ready to work with Kotlin.
<img decoding="async" width="597" height="324" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor6.png" alt="Kotlin Environment Setup">
With these simple steps, it is easy downloading Eclipse and Kotlin on your system and write your first Kotlin program right away.
A well-built architecture is important for an application to scale up its features and meet the expectations of the end-user base. Kotlin has its own peculiar and distinctive architecture to allocate the memory and to get quality outcomes for the developers and end-users.
Kotlin’s coroutines and classes architect the core in such a way to produce less boilerplate code, amplify the performance, and reinforce the efficiency. There are a variety of scenarios where the kotlin compiler can react differently, especially whenever it is earmarking various kinds of languages.






In the architecture diagram, it is clear that code execution is done in three easy steps.
When a couple of byte coded file operates on JVM, they kindle the mutual communication among themselves, which is why the feature in Kotlin called interoperability for java ook birth
The transpiring of Kotlin to JavaScript happens when Kotlin targets JavaScript.
When the JavaScript’s target is chosen, any code of Kotlin that is a part of the library that sails with Kotlin is than spilled with JavaScript. However, the Java Development Kit(JDK) or any java library used is excluded.
A non-Kotlin file is not taken into consideration during such operation. While targeting JavaScript .kt file is converted into ES5.1 by Kotlin compiler to generate a consistent code for JavaScript. Kotlin compiler endeavors an optimal size output, interoperability with existing module, same functionality with the standard library, and output that is JavaScript readable.
It is clear from the discussion that Kotlin Compilers can create a more efficient, competent, and independent code that further results in a high-performing software product.
Variables are used to store data to be manipulated and referenced in the program. It is fundamentally a unit of storing data and labeling it waits for an expository alias so that the program is simple to read and easy to understand. In other words, we can say that variables are the containers to collect information.
In Kotlin, all the variables should be declared. However, if any variable is not declared, then it pops out to be a syntax error. Also, the declaration of the variable determines the type of data we are allowing to store in the variable. In Kotlin, variables can be defined using val and var keywords. Here is the syntax of declaring variables in Kotlin:
Here, we have declared the local variable day whose value is “Monday’ and whose type is String and another local variable number whose value is 3 and whose type is Int because here the literal is of the type integer that is 3.
Local variables are customarily declared and initialized simultaneously. We can also perform certain operations while initializing the Kotlin variable.
We can perform an operation on the variable of the same data type, as in here num1 and num2 both are of the same data type that is Int, whereas day is of the string data type. Ergo, it will show an error. Here is one another technique how can you define variables in Kotlin.
Let see how var and val keywords are different from each other.
Var is like a generic variable used in any programming language that can be utilized multiple times in a single program. Moreover, you can change its value anytime in a program. Therefore, it is known as the mutable variable.
Here is an example of mutable variable in Kotlin:
Here the value of num1 that is 20, is overwritten by the previous value of num1 that is 10. Therefore the output of num1 + num2 is 40 instead of 30.
Val is like a constant variable, and you cannot change its value later in the program, which neither can be assigned multiple times in a single program and can be used only once in a particular program. Ergo, it is known as an immutable variable.
Here is an Kotlin program example of immutable variables in Kotlin:
Here, the value of num1 that is 10 cannot be overwritten by the new value of num1 that is 20, as it is of val type that is constant. Therefore, the output is 30 instead of 40.
Note: In Kotlin, immutable variables are preferred over mutable variables.
Data types are set of relatable values and describe the operations that can be operated on them. Similar to other programming languages, Kotlin also has its predefined set of data types like Int, Boolean, Char, Double, etc.
In Kotlin, every data type is considered as an object.
Now in this Kotlin basic Tutorial, let’s dive deeper into the predefined data types used in Kotlin.
Kotlin serves a set of built-in data types known as numbers, which are sub-categorize as Integers and Floating-Point Numbers.
Integers are the category of numbers that has four types:
Floating Point Numbers are the non-Integer numbers that carry some decimal values.
Float: Float is a 32- bit single-precision floating-point value.
Example: var: Float x = 3.25600
Double: Double is a 64- bit double – precision floating point value.
Example: var: Double y = 2456.345587
Booleans data type in Kotlin is significant to represent the logical values. There are only two possible values in Boolean that is either true or false.
For Example: val day = true
Val day2 = false
Characters in Kotlin are represented with the help of the keyword called char. In Kotlin, single quotes represent the declaration of char. In java, char are sometimes used as numbers that is not possible in kotlin.
For Example:
Type Conversion is a procedure of converting one type of data variable into another data type variable. It is enormously, also known as Type Casting.
Eminently, in Java, implicit type of type conversion or implicit type of typecasting of a smaller data type to larger data type is supported.
However, in kotlin, implicit conversion of a smaller data type to a larger data type is not at all supported that is int data type cannot be converted into long data type implicitly.
However, In Kotlin, type conversion is done explicitly. Here comes the guidance of helper functions that guides the conversion of one data type variable to another.
There are certain helper function which are pre – owned for the conversion of one data type to another :
toInt()
toByte()
toShort()
toChar()
toLong()
toFloat()
toDouble()
Operators are momentous and special characters or symbols that assures the operations in operands that have variables and values. In Kotlin, there is a set of operators that are used in different operations like arithmetic operations, assignment operations, comparison operations, etc.
Arithmetic operators are used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
For Example:
Here the output of the following code is 45.
Comparison operator is used to compare two values, two variables or two numbers. It is used with the greater than symbol( > ), less than symbol( < ) and equal to symbol( ==), not equal to symbol( != ), greater than equal to symbol( >= ), less than equal to symbol(<= ). It always results in true or false.
For Example:
Assignment Operators are used to assign the arithmetic operated values. It is used with the symbols like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
For Example:
Increment and decrement operators are used to increment and decrement the values of the variable or number. It is used with the help of symbols like ++ and —.
There are two types of increment and decrement that are pre-increment ++a, post-increment a++, pre decrement –b, post decrement b–.
For Example:
An Array is the homogenous set of data types and is one of the most fundamental data types which is used to store the same types of data in the contiguous memory location. An Array is significant for the organization of data in any programming language so that multiple data stored ant a single place is easy to search or sort.
In Kotlin, arrays are a mutable collaboration of the same data types rather than being native data types.
Here are certain properties of an array in Kotlin
In Kotlin, an array can be defined in two different methods
In Kotlin, there is a major usage of library functions. One such library function is arrayOf() function, which is used to define an array by passing the values of the variables to the function.
For Example: Implicit type declaration of array using arrayOf() function
For Example: Explicitly type declaration of array using arrayOf() function.
In Kotlin, there is a class with the name of Array. Therefore, it is feasible to use an array of the constructor to create an array. The array in constructor holds two major parameters.
The function where an array index is acceptable to return the initial value of the index.
For Example:
Here, the value of array is 7 and lambda expression is used to initialize the values of the element.
There are also various methods to access and modify the arrays using certain functions. Therefore, there are two member functions get() and set(), which are used to access class array’s objects.
For Example:
Here, the output is 10 since the value at the index 0 of array is 10
Note : get() takes only single values
For Example:
Output : 30 40
Here, the output is 30 and 40 since the value at the index 2 of array is 30 and at index 3 it is 40.
Note: set() takes multiple values of an array.
A string is a basic data type in any programming language. A string is nothing but a sequence of characters. The String class represents character strings. In Kotlin, all strings are objects of the String class, which means string literals are implemented as instances of the class.
Syntax:
A collection contains several objects of a similar type, and these objects in the collection are called elements or items. Collection can help to store, retrieve, manipulate, and aggregate data.
Immutable collection
This type of collection support read-only functionalities. One cannot modify its elements.
Methods include:
Mutable Collection
It supports both read and write functionality.
Methods include
Functions in any programming language is a group of similar statements which is designated to perform a specific task. Functions allow a program to break it into various small code blocks. This division of code increases the readability of code, reusability of code, and makes a program easy to manage.
As Kotlin is known as a statically typed language. Here, the ‘fun’ keyword is used to declare a function. In Kotlin, there are two types of functions which solely depends upon its availability in the standard library or user definition. They are:





Now, let us discuss them in detail with Kotlin code examples.
They are built-in library functions that can be defined implicitly and available for use.
For Example 2:
Output:
3.0
sqrt() is a function defined in the library which returns the square root of a number.
print() function prints message to a standard output stream.
As the name suggests, these functions are usually created by users, and they can be used for advanced programming.
Here, functions are declared using the ‘fun’ keyword.
For Example 3:
Here, we call the function to run codes inside the body functionName()
Kotlin function examples:
Output:
sum = 17
code after sum
Exception in programming is defined as a runtime problem which occurs in the program, leading it to terminate. This issue can occur due to less memory space, array out of bond, conditions like division by zero. To curb these types of issues in code execution, exception handling is used.
Exception handling is defined as the technique which handles the runtime problems and also maintains the program flow during execution.
Kotlin uses the ‘throw’ expression to throw an exception object. Here all exception classes are descendants of class Throwable.
Throw MyException(“throws exception”)
There are four types of exceptions in exception handling. They are:
In try-catch block in exception handling, try block encloses the code, which may throw an exception and catch block catches the expression and handles it.
Syntax of try catch block:
Syntax of try with finally block
In Kolin, finally block always checks whether the exception is handled or not, making it a very important statement of exception handling.
For Example 4:
In this code snippet, the exception occurs, and it is handled.
Output:
Throw block throws an explicit exception. Moreover, it is used to throw custom exceptions.
Syntax:
Example:
Output:

The types of systems that support Kotlin majorly distinguishes among the references that can carry nullable references, and the ones cannot carry nullable references. Kotlin is a null safety language aimed to eliminate the null pointer exception or null reference from the code, which is deliberately known as A Billion Dollar Mistake.
The most conventional stumbling block of many programming languages is that while accessing a member of a null reference, it results to be a NullPointerException, which could be because of !! operator or this constructor used somewhere else and passed at another point of code. The nullable property requires confirmation for the null check every time prior to its utilization.
In Kotlin, the system distinguishes between null references and not null references.
For example, a String variable cannot hold null:
For Example 5:
Output:
<img decoding="async" width="879" height="104" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor10.png" alt="Kotlin Null Safety">
The object-oriented programming approach allows a complex code snippet to divide into smaller code blocks by creating objects. These objects mutually share two characteristics: state and behavior.
Here are some of the OOPs elements that we are going to discuss with Kotlin code examples:
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="130" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/120419_0609_KotlinTutor11.png" alt="Kotlin OOPs">
The first before creating an object, we need to define a class that is also known as the blueprint for the object.
Syntax:
While defining a class, we only define the specifications for the object, no other parameter like memory or storage is allocated.
Syntax:
A constructor is a way to initialize class properties. It’s a member function called when an object is instantiated. But in Kotlin, it works differently.
There are two types of constructors in Kotlin:






Primary constructor: Optimized way to initialize a class
Syntax:
Secondary constructor: Helps to add initialization logic 
Inheritance occurs when some properties of the parent class are acquired by the child class. Inheritance is allowed when two or more classes have the same properties.
Syntax:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but we can inherit subclasses from them. ‘abstract ‘ keyword is used to declare an abstract class.
For Example 6:
Output:

<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto9.png" alt="MariaDB Command Prompt" width="412" height="366">
Step 3) The MariaDB command prompt will be started. It is now time to login. You should login as the root user and the password that you set during the installation of MariaDB. Type the following command on the command prompt:
Step 4) Enter the password and hit the return key. You should be logged in, as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto10.png" alt="MariaDB Command Prompt" width="671" height="218">
You are now logged into MariaDB.
MariaDB supports the following data types:
These include the following:
They include the following:
These include the following:
They include the following:
To create a new database in MariaDB, you should have special privileges which are only granted to the root user and admins.
To create a new database, you should use the CREATE DATABASE command which takes the following syntax:
In this case, you need to create a database and give it the name Demo.
Start the MariaDB command prompt and login as the root user by typing the following command:
Type the root password and hit the return key. You will be logged in.
Now, run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto11.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="331" height="60">
You have then created a database named Demo. It will be good for you to confirm whether the database was created successfully or not. You only have to show the list of the available databases by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto12.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="285" height="163">
The above output shows that the Demo database is part of the list, hence the database was created successfully.
For you to be able to use or work on a particular database, you have to select it from the list of the available databases. After selecting a database, you can perform tasks such as creating tables within the database.
To select a database, you should use the USE command. It takes the syntax given below:
You need to use the Demo database. You can select it by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto13.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="238" height="49">
The above image shows that the MariaDB command prompt has changed from none to the name of the database that has been selected.
You can now go ahead and create tables within the Demo database.
For you to be able to create a table, you must have selected a database. The table can be created using the CREATE TABLE statement. Here is the syntax for the command:
You can set one of the columns to be the primary key. This column should not allow null values.
We will create two tables within the Demo database, Book, and Price tables. Each table will have two columns.
Let’s begin by creating the Book table with two columns, id and name. Run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto14.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="320" height="93">
The PRIMARY KEY constraint has been used to set the id column as the primary key for the table. The AUTO_INCREMENT property will increment the values of the id column by 1 automatically for each new record inserted into the table. All the columns will not allow null values.
Now, create the second table, the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto15.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="325" height="94">
The id column has been set as the primary key for the table.
Now that you have created the two tables, it will be good for you to conform whether the tables were created successfully or not. You can show the list of tables contained in a database by running the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto16.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="250" height="128">
The above screenshot shows that the two tables were created successfully within the Demo database.
To see the structure of any particular table, you can use the DESCRIBE command, commonly abbreviated as DESC. It takes the following syntax:
For example, to see the structure of the table named Book, you can run the following command;
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto17.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="526" height="131">
The table has two columns. To see the structure of the Price table, you can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto18.png" alt="Create a Database and Tables in MariaDB" width="486" height="132">
To insert data into a MariaDB table, you should use the INSERT INTO statement. This command takes the syntax given below:
The above syntax shows that you have to specify the table columns into which you want to insert data as well as the data that you need to insert.
Let us insert a record into the Book table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto19.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="304" height="85">
You have inserted a single record into the table. Insert a record into the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto20.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="305" height="87">
The record has been created.
The SELECT statement helps us to view or see the contents of a database table. To see the contents of the Book table, for example, you need to run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto21.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="298" height="121">
Now, view the contents of the Price table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto22.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-INSERT" width="303" height="122">
It is possible for us to insert multiple records into a MariaDB table at a go. To demonstrate this, run the following example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto23.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="329" height="145">
You can query the table to check whether the records were inserted successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto24.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="288" height="166">
The records were inserted successfully. Insert multiple records into the Price table by running this example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto25.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="322" height="140">
Let’s confirm whether the records were created successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto26.png" alt="Inserting Multiple Records" width="304" height="166">
The UPDATE command helps us to change or modify the records that have already been inserted into a table. You can combine it with the WHERE clause to specify the record that is to be updated. Here is the syntax:
The UPDATE command can also be combined with clauses such as SET, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY. You will see this shortly:
Consider the table named Price with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto27.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="304" height="166">
Let’s change the price of the book with an id of 1 from 200 to 250:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto28.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="336" height="95">
The command ran successfully. You can now query the table to see whether the change took place:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto29.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="301" height="167">
The above screenshot shows that the change has been implemented. Consider the table Book with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto30.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="302" height="170">
Let us change the name of the book named Book to MariaDB Book1. Notice that the book has an id of 1. Here is the command for this:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto31.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="335" height="95">
Check whether the change has been implemented:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto32.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="294" height="164">
The above screenshot shows that the change has been implemented successfully.
In the above examples, we have only changed one column at a time. However, it is possible for us to change multiple columns at a go. Let us demonstrate this using an example.
Let us use the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto33.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="300" height="166">
Let us change both the id and the price of the book with an id of 5. We will change its id to 6 and price to 6. Run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto34.png" alt="  CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="335" height="103">
Now, query the table to check whether the change was made successfully:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto35.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-UPDATE" width="307" height="167">
The change was made successfully.
We use the DELETE command when we need to delete either one or many records from a table. Here is the syntax for the command:
Consider the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto36.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="307" height="167">
We need to delete the last record from the table. It has an id of 6 and a price of 280. Let us delete the record:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto37.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="306" height="68">
The command ran successfully. Let us query the table to confirm whether the deletion was successful:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto38.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DELETE" width="304" height="150">
The output shows that the record was deleted successfully.
The WHERE clause helps us to specify the exact location where we need to make a change. It is used together with statements such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Consider the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto39.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="304" height="150">
Suppose we need to see the records in which the price is less than 250. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto40.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="232" height="154">
All the records in which the price is below 250 have been returned.
The WHERE clause can be combined with the AND statement. Suppose we need to see all records in the Price table where the price is below 250 and id is above 3. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto41.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="222" height="158">
Only one record has been returned. The reason is that it has to meet all the conditions that have been specified, that is, id above 3 and price below 250. If any of these conditions is violated, then the record will not be returned.
The clause can also be combined with the OR command. Let us replace the AND in our previous command with OR and see the kind of output that we receive:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto42.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="214" height="162">
We now get 2 records rather than 1. This is because, for a record of qualifying, it only has to meet one of the specified conditions.
This clause is used to specify the data pattern when accessing table data in which an exact match is necessary. It can be combined with the INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT and DELETE statements.
You should pass the pattern of data you are looking for to the clause, and it will return either true or false. Here are the wildcard characters that can be used together with the clause:
Here is the syntax for the LIKE clause:
Let us demonstrate how to use the clause with the % wildcard character. Let us use the Book table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto43.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="296" height="165">
We need to see all records in which the name begins with M. We can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto44.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="237" height="189">
All records have been returned because their names begin with the letter M. To see all names that end with 4, you can run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto45.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="246" height="140">
Only one name has been returned because it’s the only one meeting the condition.
We can also surround the search pattern by the wildcard:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto46.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="252" height="187">
Other than the % wildcard, the LIKE clause can be used together with the _ wildcard. This is the underscore wildcard, and it will only look for a single character.
Let’s work with the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto47.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="302" height="151">
Let us check for the record in which the price is like 1_0. We run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto48.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="251" height="141">
It has returned the record in which the price is 190. We can also try another pattern:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto49.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="250" height="141">
It is possible for us to use the LIKE clause together with the NOT operator. This will return all the records that don’t meet the specified pattern. For example:
Let us use the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto50.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="294" height="148">
Let us find all the records where the price does not start with 2:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto51.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="279" height="141">
Only one record does not meet the specified pattern.
This clause helps us to sort out our records in either ascending or descending order. We use it with the SELECT statement, as shown below:
It is possible for us to use this clause without adding either the ASC or DESC part. For example:
We will use the Price table with the following records:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto52.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="298" height="150">
Run the following command against the table:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto53.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="296" height="164">
In the above command, we have ordered by the price. The records have been ordered with the prices in ascending order. That means that when we don’t specify the order, the sorting is done in ascending order by default.
Let us run the clause with the DESC option:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto54.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="295" height="165">
The records have been sorted with the price in descending order as we have specified.
Let us use the ORDER BY clause together with the ASC attribute:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto55.png" alt=" CRUD and Clauses-Where" width="294" height="162">
The records have been ordered but with the prices in ascending order. This is similar to when we use the ORDER BY clause without either ASC or DESC attributes.
This clause helps us to do away with duplicates when selecting records from a table. This means that it helps us get unique records. Its syntax is given below:
To demonstrate this, we will use the Price table with the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto56.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="301" height="151">
When we select the price column from the table, we get the following result:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto57.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="338" height="153">
We have two records with a price of 250, creating a duplicate. We need to have only unique records. We can filter these by use of the DISTINCT clause as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto58.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-DISTINCT" width="400" height="146">
We now don’t have any duplicates in the above output.
The FROM clause used for fetching data from a database table. It can also help when joining tables. Here is the syntax for the command:
To see the contents of the book table, run the following command:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto59.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-From" width="300" height="152">
The clause can help you to fetch only a single column from a database table. For example:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto60.png" alt="CRUD and Clauses-From" width="328" height="153">
A procedure is a MariaDB program that you can pass parameters to. A procedure doesn’t return values. To create a procedure, we use the CREATE PROCEDURE command.
To demonstrate how to create and call a procedure, we will create a procedure named myProcedure() that helps us select the name column from the book table. Here is the procedure:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto61.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="408" height="113">
The procedure has been created. We have simply enclosed the SELECT statement within the BEGIN and END clauses of the procedure.
Now, we can call the procedure by its name as shown below:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto62.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="317" height="201">
The procedure returns the name column of the book table when called.
We can create a procedure that takes in a parameter. For example, we need to select the name of the book and filter using the book id. We can create the following procedure for this:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto63.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="509" height="115">
Above, we have created a procedure named myProcedure2(). This procedure takes one integer parameter named book_id which is the id of the book whose name we need to see. To see the name of the book with an id of 3, we can call the procedure as follows:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto64.png" alt="Advanced Tasks-Stored Procedure" width="311" height="152">
Unlike procedures, we must pass parameters to functions and a function must return a value. To create a function in MariaDB, we use the CREATE FUNCTION statement. The statement takes the following syntax:
The above parameters are described below:
Here is an example MariaDB function:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto65.png" alt="Function in MariaDB" width="410" height="252">
We can then call the above function as follows:
The command will return the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto66.png" alt="Function in MariaDB" width="304" height="113">
Once you are done with a function, it will be good for you to delete it. This is easy as you only have to call the DROP FUNCTION statement that takes the following syntax:
For example, to drop the function named myFunc, we can run the following command:
When you need to retrieve data from more than one tables at a go, use MariaDB JOINS. This means that a JOIN works on two or more tables. The following three types of JOINS are supported in MariaDB:
Let us discuss them one-by-one:
The inner join returns all rows from the tables in which the join condition is true. Its syntax is as follows:
For example:
We will use our two tables, books, and book.
The book table has the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto67.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="290" height="159">
The Price table has the following data:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto68.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="300" height="149">
The goal is to join the name column from the Book table and the price column from Price table into a single table. This is possible with an inner join, as demonstrated below:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto69.png" alt="INNER JOIN" width="376" height="189">
This join returns all the rows from the left-hand table and only rows in which the join condition is true from the other table. Its syntax is as follows:
The OUTER keyword has been placed within square brackets because it is optional.
For example:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto70.png" alt="LEFT OUTER JOIN" width="369" height="197">
The last record in the above table has no matching value on the left. That is why it has been replaced with NULL.
This join returns all the rows from the right-hand table and only rows in which the join condition is true from the other table. Its syntax is as follows:
The OUTER keyword has been placed within square brackets because it is optional.
For example:
The command returns the following:
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0606_MariaDBTuto71.png" alt="RIGHT OUTER JOIN" width="372" height="188">
The reason is that all rows in the right-hand table were matched to those in the other table. If some of the rows did not match, we would have NULLs in the first column.

ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is very easy to use, and it allows users to create reusable UI components.
JSX : JSX is an extension to javascript. Though it is not mandatory to use JSX in react, it is one of the good features and easy to use.
Components: Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code. We can use components as functions and components as classes. Components also have a state, props which makes life easy. Inside a class, the state of each of the props is maintained.
Virtual DOM: React creates a virtual dom, i.e., in-memory data -structure cache. Only the final changes of DOM has later updated in the browsers DOM.
Javascript Expressions: JS expressions can be used in the jsx files using curly brackets, for example {}.
Here, are important pros/benefits of using ReactJS:
Here, are cons/ drawbacks of using ReactJS:
To start working with react, we need to first install reactjs. You can easily get started to use reactjs by using the CDN javascript files, as shown below.
Go to the official site of reactjs to get the CDN links, i.e., https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html and you will get the required files to explain the following image.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="936" height="625" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto1.png" alt="Using ReactJS from CDN">
Replace version with the latest react version for both react-development.js and react-dom.developement.js. You can host the files at your end to start working with reactjs.
In case if you are planning to use the CDN files, make sure to keep the cross-origin attribute, to avoid cross-domain issues. Reactjs code cannot be executed directly in the browser and needs to be transpired using Babel to javascript before executing in the browser.
Here is the BabelJS script that can be used:
Here is the working ReactJS example using cdn files and babeljs script.
Output:
<img decoding="async" width="494" height="123" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto2.png" alt="For prod Output">
We will get into the details of the code in the next chapter, let us see the working here with CDN files. It is said that using babel script directly is not a good practice, and newcomers can just use it to learn reactjs for now. In production, you will have to install react using npm package.
Make sure you have nodejs installed.  If not installed, go through this tutorial for nodejs (https://www.guru99.com/node-js-tutorial.html) installation.
Once you have nodejs installed, create a folder reactproj/.
To start with project setup, run command npm init.
This is how the folder structure will look like:
Now we will install the packages that we need.
Here are the list of packages for reactjs:
Open the command prompt and run above commands inside the folder reactproj/.
Create a folder src/ where all the js code will come in that folder. All the code for reactjs project will be available in the src/ folder. Create a file index.js and add import react and react-dom, as shown below.
index.js
We have returned the basic code for reactjs. We will explain the details of it in the next chapter. We want to display Hello, from Guru99 Tutorials and the same is given to the dom element with id “root”.It is taken from the index.html file, which is the start file, as shown below.
Create a folder public/ and add index.html in that as shown below
index.html
The package react-scripts will take care of compiling the code and starting the server to display the html file i.e index.html. You need to add the command in package.json that will take care of using react-scripts to compile the code and start server as shown below:
After installing all the packages and adding the above command, the final package.json is as follows:
Package.json
To start testing reactjs run the command
It will open browser with url http://localhost:3000/  as shown below:
public/index.html
<img decoding="async" width="559" height="183" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto3.png" alt="Using NPM Packages">
We are going to use the same process to execute the javascript files in the next chapters too. Add all your js and .jsx file in src/ folder .The file structure will be as follows:
Here is a step by step guide in this ReactJS Tutorial to start with the first react application.
Step 1) Import the react packages.
1. To start with ReactJS, we need to first import the react packages as follows.
2. Save the file as index.js in src/ folder
Step 2) Write Simple Code.
We will write a simple code in this tutorial React JS, wherein we will display the message “Hello, from Guru99 Tutorials!”
ReactDOM.render will add the <h1> tag to the element with id root. Here is the html file we are having:
Step 3) Compile the Code.
Next in this React.js Tutorial, we need to compile the code to get the output in the browser.
Here is the folder structure:
We have added the commands to compile the final file in package.json as follows:
To compile the final file  run following command:
When you run above command, it will compile the files and notify you if any error, if all looks good, it will open the browser and the run the index.html file at http://localhost:3000/index.html
Command: npm run start:
Step 4) Check Output.
The URL http://localhost:3000 will open in  the browser once the code is compiled as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="559" height="183" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto4.png" alt="Output of First React Project">
JSX is an extension to javascript. It is a template script where you will have the power of using HTML and Javascript together.
Here is a simple example of a JSX code.
For a UI, we need Html, and each element in the dom will have events to be handled, state changes, etc.
In case of React, it allows us to make use of Html and javascript in the same file and take care of the state changes in the dom in an efficient manner.
Here is a simple example of how to use expressions in JSX.
In earlier ReactJS examples, we had written something like :
index.js
We will now change the above code to add expressions. Expressions are used inside curly brackets {}, and they are expanded during run time. Expressions in react are the same as javascript expressions.
index.js
Let us now test the same in the browser.
<img decoding="async" width="295" height="195" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto5.png" alt="Expressions in JSX Output">
You can see that the {display} expression is not replaced. React does not know what to do when an expression is used inside the .js file.
Let us now add changes and create a .jsx file, as shown below:
test.jsx
We have added the required code and will use the text.jsx file in index.js.We want the h1tag variable to be used inside script.js, so the same is exported as shown above in the test.jsx
Here is the modified code in index.js


We can use the h1tag now in the ReactDOM.render as shown below:
Here is the output when we check the same in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="406" height="145" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto6.png" alt="Output">
Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code.
test.jsx


The Component Hello is used as an Html tag, i.e., <Hello /> and assigned to Hello_comp variable and the same is exported using export.
Let us now use this component in index.js file as shown below:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="427" height="129" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto7.png" alt="Output of Components in ReactJS">
Here is a ReactJS example that uses a class as a component.
test.jsx
We can use Hello component in index.js file as follows:
index.js
The Component Hello is used as an Html tag i.e., <Hello />.
Here is the output of the same.
<img decoding="async" width="448" height="169" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto8.png" alt="Class as Component Output">
A state is a javascript object similar to props that have data to be used with the reactjs render. The state data is a private object and is used within components inside a class.
Here is a working example on how to use state inside a class.
test.jsx
index.js
This is what we get when we test it in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="478" height="116" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto9.png" alt="State in ReactJS Output">
Props are properties to be used inside a component. They act as global object or variables which can be used inside the Component.
Here is an example of passing props to a function component.
As shown above, we have added msg attribute to <Hello /> Component. The same can be accessed as props inside Hello function, which is an object that will have the msg attribute details, and the same is used as an expression.
The component is used in index.js as follows:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="604" height="141" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto10.png" alt="Props to Function Component Output">
To access the props in a class we can do it as follows:
test.jsx
The msg attribute is passed to the component in index.js as follows:
This is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="479" height="135" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto11.png" alt="Props to Class Component Output">

A component life cycle is divided into Initialization, Mounting, Update, and UnMounting stages.
Here is a detail explanation about each Component.
A component in reactjs has the following stages :
Initialization: This is the first stage of the component life cycle.
Here it will have the default props and the state at the initial level.
Mounting: In this phase, the Component is rendered inside the dom. We having exposure to following methods in the mounting state.
Update: In this state, the dom is interacted by a user and updated. For example, you enter something in the textbox, so the state properties are updated.
Following are the methods available in update state:
UnMounting: this state comes into the picture when the Component is not required or removed.
Following are the methods available in unmount state:
Component willUnmount(): called when the Component is removed or destroyed.
Here is a working example which shows the methods called at each state.
Example: complife.jsx
index.js
When you check the output in the browser
<img decoding="async" width="351" height="161" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto12.png" alt="Output">
In browser console you get :
<img decoding="async" width="524" height="23" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto13.png" alt="Browser Console Output">
When the user enters in the textbox:
<img decoding="async" width="395" height="163" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto14.png" alt="User Values Output">
In console following messages are displayed:
<img decoding="async" width="519" height="314" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto15.png" alt="Console Output">
In reactjs Html  input elements like <input />, <textarea /> and <select /> has their own state and needs to be updated when user interacts using the setState() method.
In this chapter, we will see how to work with forms in reactjs.
Here is a working example:
form.jsx
For the input fields, we need to maintain the state, so for that react provides a special method called setState, which helps to maintain the state whenever there is a change.
We have used events onChange and onClick on the textbox and submit button. When the user enters inside the textbox the onChange event  is called, and the name field inside state object state is updated as shown below:
index.js
The output in the browser is as follows:
<img decoding="async" width="375" height="143" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto16.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
Step 1) Enter your name in the textbox:
<img decoding="async" width="450" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto17.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
<img decoding="async" width="450" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto18.png" alt="Working with Forms Output">
Working with events in reactjs is same as how you would have done in javascript. You can use all the event handlers that are used in javascript. The setState() method is used to update the state when the user interacts with any Html element.
Here is a working example of how to use events in reactjs.
events.jsx
For the input fields, we need to maintain the state, so for that react provides a special method called setState, which helps to maintain the state whenever there is a change.
We have used events onChange and onClick on the textbox and button. When the user enters inside the textbox the onChange event  is called, and the name field inside state object  state is updated as shown below:
index.js
Here is the output in the browser:
<img decoding="async" width="362" height="128" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto19.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
When a user enters the name :
<img decoding="async" width="419" height="176" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto20.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
When the user clicks on the Click Here button:
<img decoding="async" width="449" height="180" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto21.png" alt="Working with Events Output">
Will take a look at a working example to understand the working of inline css in reactjs.
addstyle.jsx
I have added color: ‘red’ style to the h1 tag.
index.js
The output in the browser is as follows:
<img decoding="async" width="505" height="161" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto22.png" alt="Working with Inline CSS Output">
You can create an object of style that you want on the element and use an expression to add style, as shown in the example above.
Let us create a external css , for that create a folder css/ and add style.css in it.
style.css
Add the style.css to your index.html file
Now let us add the class to the h1 tag in .jsx file
addstyle.jsx
index.js
The className attribute is given the class details. Now let us test in the browser.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="190" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto23.png" alt="Working with External CSS Output">
This is what you see when you inspect the h1 tag in browser:
<img decoding="async" width="449" height="150" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/082319_0642_ReactJSTuto24.png" alt="Working with External CSS Output">
You can see that the class=” h1tag” is added successfully to the h1 tag.

Web services is a standardized way or medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web. This course will give a detailed insight into various components of web services like SOAP, WSDL, REST, and how they operate.
This course is designed for beginners having basic knowledge of web services protocols and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) principles.
Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web.
Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other
Popular Web Services Protocols are:
SOAP is known as the Simple Object Access Protocol.
SOAP was developed as an intermediate language so that applications built on various programming languages could talk quickly to each other and avoid the extreme development effort.
WSDL is known as the Web Services Description Language(WSDL).
WSDL is an XML-based file which tells the client application what the web service does and gives all the information required to connect to the web service.
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
REST is used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable.

Microsoft Access is a Database Management System offered by Microsoft. It uses the Microsoft Jet Database Engine and comes as a part of the Microsoft Office suite of application.
Microsoft Access offers the functionality of a database and the programming capabilities to create easy to navigate screens (forms). It helps you analyze large amounts of information, and manage data efficiently.
Now in this Microsoft Access tutorial, we will learn about some important terms and basic objects in MS Access:
It is a file which stores the entire database. The database file is saved to your hard drive or other storage devices. 
Datatypes are the properties of each field.  Every field has one datatype like text, number, date, etc. 
Macros are mini computer programming constructs. They allow you to set up commands and processes in your forms, like, searching, moving to another record, or running a formula.
Modules are procedures(functions) which you can write using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
MS Access common data types are listed below:
Microsoft Access and Excel are very similar yet very different. Here, are some important difference points between both of them-

Here, are the cons for using MS Access
Note: We assume you have the latest Microsoft Access installed which comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 package.
There are two ways to Start MS Access. 
Now in this Microsoft Access tutorial, let’s have a look of starting MS Access using both the ways:
Step 1) Click on the ‘Windows’ icon. You will find the list of installed programs.
Step 2)  Find Access icon. Check and click on Access Icon.

Before we create a Database, lets quickly understand the holistic picture of what Database is, with particular reference to MS Access.
Let’s, start with a few real-life Microsoft Access databases example:
Similarly, we have MS Access Database is a kind of home for all your Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports, etc. in MS Access which are interlinked. 
Technically, Database store the data in a well-organized manner for easy access and retrieval.

Datasheet View
Displays in the view, which allows you to enter raw data into your database table.
Design view:	
Displays the view, which allows you to enter fields, data types, and descriptions into your database table.
To understand form lets first create two new Record in Contact Table (from the prebuilt Contact Database discussed here)
Step 1) Select the ‘Contact’ table from Left Navigation.
Step 2) Create two rows by entering some relevant data in two rows.
<img decoding="async" width="845" height="296" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/041519_1116_MSACCESSTut46.png" alt="Forms in MS Access">
create Form, and then we will see how forms can be leverage for easy display, editing, and creation of new data. 
There are four primary ways to create the form as mentioned below:
Let’s have a look at each option to create the form, one by one:
This option allows the user to create the form with the wizard and select the column from the available list of column form in legacy Select window format.
Step 1) Click on ‘Form Wizard.’

You should have Ruby installed from the previous section, and now you are going to install Rails. You can install Rails using a package from RailsInstaller, but the problem with this is that you don’t get the latest version of the required packages.
If you have already have the latest Ruby and a baseline set of required RubyGems and extensions installed. All you need do now is run the following command at the command prompt to get Rails on your system: ‘gem install rails.’
You will also need to install Node.js if you don’t already have it because some libraries that Rails depends on require a Javascript runtime to work correctly. You can get node at https://nodejs.org.
It is a more common and preferred approach to developing on Windows. Rails community uses a Windows Subsystem for Linux that provides a GNU/Linux environment with command-line tools, utilities, and common applications directly on Windows.
Your Mac already has Ruby pre-installed on it. However, the pre-installed version might be old, and so you will need to install a new/latest version.
The easiest way to do this is by using a package manager such as Homebrew. You might first need to install Homebrew by running the command below at the Terminal.
This will display a warning and ask you to enter your password. Enter your Mac password (you won’t see the characters as you type). Just press ‘Enter’ when you are done typing your password. Then run this simple Homebrew command to install Ruby on your Mac.
And also run this command:
To set this Ruby installation as the default Ruby to run on your system and not the pre-installed Ruby.
To confirm the Installation was successful, you can run the following at the Terminal
this will print the Ruby version number you have installed. The output will look something like
The easiest way to get Ruby installed on your Ubuntu system is through the apt package manager. You need to run the following commands at the Terminal to install the latest Ruby from Ubuntu repositories.
To confirm the Installation was successful, you can run the following ‘ruby –version,’ this will print the Ruby version you have installed. 
You should follow the steps below to successfully install Rails on your Linux machine.
Step 1) Update your computer gem manager by running ‘gem update –system’ at the Terminal or command prompt.
Step 2) Run ‘gem install rails’ to install the latest version of Rails on your computer.
Step 3) You should install bundler gem for easy Rails application gem dependency management. Run ‘gem install bundler’ to get it.
Rails follow basic software design principles and encourage you to use those principles too.
The two most common are:
With Rails now installed on your system lets create a Rails application! We will learn Ruby on Rails examples and how to create a Todo list application in this Ruby on Rails tutorial. Run the following command ‘rails new todo_app’ in your Terminal to create the application.
This command creates a directory named ‘todo_app’ in the current directory with the basic folder structure of a Rails web application, as shown in the Figure below:
<img decoding="async" width="542" height="700" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails5.png" alt="Rails – Project File Structures">
You will go through the main directories in this Ruby on Rails example.
app – This directory groups using different subdirectories for the UI/layout (views and helpers), the controller (controllers files) and the models (business/application logic).
app/controllers – This directory stores controller files used by Rails to handle requests from the client.
app/assets – It contains static files, which is a need for the application’s front-end grouped into folders based on their type – JavaScript files, images, and stylesheets.
app/helpers – This subdirectory contains helper functions that make your application model, view, and controller logic focused, small and uncluttered.
app/models – This contains files
that model your application’s database. The model classes make working with the database very easy.
app/views – This hold template/layout files the user of your application interacts with. The templates are a combination of HTML and data from the database.
bin – It contains Rails scripts that starts your application. It can also include other scripts that you use to set up and upgrade the application.
Config – This holds configuration files – database.yml, environment.rb, routes.rb, etc. that your application needs to run.
DB – This directory contains files/scripts that are used to manage your application database.
lib – This directory contains an extended module for your application.
log – This contains log files – server.log, development.log, test.log, and production.log, etc., that are used for debugging or monitoring your application.
public – This directory contains static files and compiled assets, such as HTML files, Javascript files, images, and stylesheets.
test – This directory holds test files you write to test your application functionality.
tmp – This directory contains temporary files like cache and pid files.
vendor – This directory contains third-party libraries.
Gemfile – This file specifies what your basic gem requirements are to run your web application. You can group the gems into development, test or production and Rails will know when to include each gem.
Gemfile.lock – Unlike the Gemfile that explicitly lists the gems you want in your application, Gemfile.lock additionally contains other gems that those you list in the Gemfile depends on that are then automatically installed to satisfy the dependencies.
Readme.md – You use this file to share essential detail about your application, such as what the app does, how to go about installing and run the application.
Rakefile – This file contains various rake tasks definitions, which helps in automating everyday administration tasks of your application.
config.ru – This is a Rack configuration file that provides an interface to the webserver to start your application.
Change directory to the ‘todo_app’ directory Rails generated and run ‘rails server’ to start the application. Type localhost:3000 in the address bar of your web browser, you should see the Figure below if all went well.
<img decoding="async" width="900" height="592" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails6.png" alt="Rails – Project File Structures">
This is the default homepage of your application, and you will change this in the later section of this Ruby on Rails tutorial. You can stop the server by pressing ‘Ctrl-C’.
The Rails generate command makes use of templates to create a whole lot of useful things in your application. You can use these generators to save a lot of time.
It helps by writing boilerplate code, code that is necessary for your web application to work. You can run ‘rails generate’ by itself at the command prompt or Terminal to see a list of available generators as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="658" height="900" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails7.png" alt="Rails – Generate commands">
You can also run ‘rails generate “command”‘ to see a description of what the command does. It offers convenient options that can be run with the command and usage example. The Figure below shows the output of running‘ rails generate controller’:
<img decoding="async" width="839" height="900" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails8.png" alt="Rails – Generate commands">
You will use the rails generate scaffold command to automatically create the model, view, and controller for the todo list application you are building. Run‘ rails generate scaffold todo_list title:string description: text’ in your Terminal (check you are still in the todo_app directory).
This will create a full CRUD (Create, read, update, and delete) web interface for the TodoLists table.
Another useful command to know is ‘rails destroy,’ it reverses whatever ‘rails generate…’ does.


The Rails routing system, rails router, handles all incoming requests to your web application. It does this by examining the URL of the incoming requests and then maps each request to the controller action responsible for handling it, using special syntax specified in the routes file (config/routes.rb).
The routes file helps in controlling every URL aspect of your web application. Rails by default use a RESTful design based on the REST architectural style, that provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and requests (URLs) to controller actions.
The routes file was generated when you ran ‘rails new’ in an earlier section of this tutorial. Continuing with the Todo application that you are building, run the following‘ rails db:migrate’ (you will get to know what this does shortly)
In your command line, make sure you are still at the root of the application (the todo_app directory).
Then start the server again with ‘rails server’. Type http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/ in your browser and press Enter. You should get back a webpage as shown in the below figure of Ruby on Rails example:
<img decoding="async" width="898" height="560" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails9.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
This is the Todo lists view that the scaffold command generated and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s index action.
Go ahead and add a todo list by clicking on the ‘New Todo List’ on the page, you should get the page as shown below:
<img decoding="async" width="840" height="424" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails10.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
Notice the URL is changed to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/new. This is the page to create a new todo list, and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s new method/action.
Enter your todo list title and description in the form and click the Create Todo list button, the URL should change to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/1, shown in the below figure of Ruby on Rails code example:
<img decoding="async" width="866" height="559" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails11.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
This is the show page of a todo list, and it is controlled by the TodoListsController’s show method/action. If you go back to http://localhost:3000/todo_lists/, you should now see the Figure below with a new todo list added:
<img decoding="async" width="966" height="597" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails12.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
Rails was able to map the various requests (URLs) to the corresponding TodoListsController’s action using the route definition in config/routes.rb.
If you take a peek at this file, you see a single line ‘resources: todo_lists’, is Rails default way of writing restful routes. This single line creates seven routes all mapping to the TodoLists controller.
By convention, each controller’s action also maps to a specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operation in the database.
You can run ‘rake routes’ in your command line to see the various routes available in your application. The Figure below shows the output of running ‘rails routes’ in your command line/terminal.
<img decoding="async" width="980" height="214" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/072519_0548_RubyonRails13.png" alt="Rails – Routing">
The View layer is one of the components of the MVC paradigm and is responsible for generating HTML response for each request to your application. Rails by default use ERB (Embedded Ruby) which is a powerful templating system for Ruby.
ERB makes writing templates easy and maintainable by combining plain text with Ruby code for variable substitution and flow control. An ERB template has .html, .erb or .erb extension.
You will mostly use a combination of two tag markers only, each of which causes the embedded code to be processed and handled in a particular way.
A tag with an equal’s sign ‘<%= %>’ indicates that embedded code is an expression and that the result of the code should be substituted by the renderer when it renders the template.
The other tag with no equals sign ‘<% %>’ indicates to the renderer that the result of the code should not be substituted/printed when it renders the template.
Each controller in your Rails application has a corresponding subdirectory in app/views, and each action/method in a controller has a corresponding .html and .erb file in this directory.
Take a look at app/views of the todo app you are building. You will find a subdirectory named ‘todo_lists’ inside this subdirectory .html.erb files with names corresponding to the actions/methods in the TodoLists controller.
ActiveRecord is the Ruby implementation of the Active Record pattern, which is a simple pattern where a class represents a table, and an instance of the class represents a row in that class.
ActiveRecord is popularly referred to as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping), a technique that allows you to manage your database using a language you’re most comfortable with. It is database agnostic thus you can easily switch between databases (for example SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.). This suite more for your application requirement with the same code/logic.
So, if you want to get an array containing a listing of all the todo lists in your application, so,  instead of writing code to initiate a connection to the database, then doing some sort of SQL SELECT query, and converting those results into an array. 
For that, you just need to type ‘TodoList.all’ and Active Record gives you the array filled with TodoList objects that you can play with as you like.
All you need do is set up the right configuration in config/database.yml, and Active Record will work out all the differences between the various database system. So when you switch from one to the other, you don’t have to think about it.
You focus on writing code for your application, and Active Record will think about the low-level details of connecting you to your database. Active Record makes use of naming conventions to create the mapping between models and database tables.
Rails pluralize your model class names to find the corresponding database table. So, for a class TodoList, ActiveRecord will create a database table called TodoLists.
Rails migration is simply a script that you use to edit your application database. It is used to set up or change your database and avoids manually writing SQL code to do that.
It uses Ruby to define changes to database schema and makes it possible to use version control to keep your database synchronized.
Rails Migrations use a Ruby Domain Specific Language (DSL). This acts as an abstraction and makes it possible to use or change your database engine based on your requirements.
They can be shared with anyone working on the application and can also be rolled back to undo any changes to the database. This is a high safety mechanism as you don’t have to bother about doing permanent damage to your database.
A connection between two ActiveRecord models is known as an association. Association makes it much easier to perform operations on the different records in your code. It can be divided into four categories: –
One to One: – This indicates that a record contains precisely one instance of another model. A good example is user profile. A user has only one profile. It uses has _one keyword.
One to Many: – This is the most common association, and it indicates that one model has zero or more instances of another model. Your use has a _many keyword to denote this association.
Many to Many: – This association is a bit more complicated, and ActiveRecord provides two ways to handle it. Using the has_and_belongs_to_many and has_many, which gives you access to the relation that is defined in a separate table.
Polymorphic One to Many:- This is a more advanced association available to you in Rails. You can use it to define a model that may belong to many different models on a single association.
Validation helps to ensure that you have correct data because working with wrong data is an awful thing and could cost you your money and business.
Validation also provides an extra layer of security for your application against malicious users from gaining access to information in your database. Rails offer you a nice API of validation helpers in ActiveRecord to keep your database clean, secure, and free of errors.
ActiveRecord validations run on model objects before saving to the database, making them more reliable and also best practice to follow in building your application.
The following ActiveRecord methods evoke validations when used or called on model objects – create, create!, save, save!, update, and update!. The ones with a bang (create!, save! and update!) raise an exception if a record is invalid while thothen’t’tt’t’t.
The most common ActiveRecord validation helpers at your disposal are:-
Confirmation:– This validation helper is useful for validating two fields have the same entry. e.g., password and password confirmation, it is used in conjunction with the presence validation helper.
Presence:– This checks that the field is not empty.
uniqueness: ensures unique value for a field, e.g., username
Length:- To enforce a limit on character length of a field
You can also create your custom validation by using the validate method and passing it the name of the custom validation method.
You can check the model’s error object to find out why a validation. Hopefully, you have some ideas to make your application more constrained and more secured to only allow secure data into your database.
The Rails controller is the center of your web application. It facilitates and coordinates the communication between the user, the models, and the views.
Your controller classes inherit from the ApplicationController, that contains code that can be run in all other controllers and it inherits from ActionController class.
The controller provides the following to your application: 
You can configure the various components such as initializers, assets, generators, middlewares, etc.  By using your Rails application initializers and configuration files in the config directory. Files like config/application.rb, config/environments/development.rb  and  config/environments/test.rb etc. You can also have custom settings configure for your application.
As you build out your application, there will come a time you will need/have to debug your code. Rails make this easy using the byebug gem. You can start a debugging session by putting the ‘byebeg’ keyword anywhere in your application code.
This will temporarily stop execution at that point. The byebug gem gives you several commands to use. The most useful ones are:
There are other debugging gems available such as ‘pry’, and they all provide similar functionalities but slightly different syntax. Debugging gems should not be used in production as this pose’s risks to your application and bad experience to your application users.
There are log files that you can inspect for errors in production and handle them. Also, you should follow a TDD (Test-driven development) approach when developing your application to ensure everything works well before deploying to production.

WPF is a framework for building Windows applications that allow users to develop rich user interfaces having 3D animations and rich colors with less code complexity. It is a vector-based rendering engine that uses hardware acceleration of modern graphics cards, which makes the Ul faster and highly scalable. WPF stands for Windows Presentation Foundation.

WPF can be considered as an evolution over WinForms. It produces easy to operate graphical display system for Windows. It offers easy separation between UI and business logic.
WPF applications can be deployed in your system as a standalone desktop program or hosted as an embedded object in a website.
There are many reasons for using WPF platform some prominent ones are-
Windows 1.0 was the first GUI environment from Microsoft. It is working as a layer on top of DOS, relying on the GDI and USER systems for graphic and user interface.
DirectX was introduced in the year 1995, as a high-performance graphics system. It was aimed at games and other graphics related environments. Over the years there are many versions released with Directx9 that provides a library to use with mange.Net code.
The latest stable version of WPF 5.0.6 which is released in April 2021.
Next in this WPF C# tutorial, we will learn about WPF core types and Infrastructure.
Classes in WPF are divided into four different types:
These classes, known as base element classes. It provides the foundation for a model of composing user interfaces.
WPF user interfaces are composed of elements which are assembled in a tree hierarchy. It is called the element tree. The element tree is an intuitive way to layout user interface. It is a structure which allows you to get the feature of powerful UI services.
Extensible Application Markup Language which is called “XAML”, or “zammel” is a declarative way to define user interfaces.
Here is the XAML definition of a simple button:
Advantage of using XAML language:
WPF framework supports many useful controls like:
The appearance of controls can be customized with styles and templates without programming. You can also create a custom control by deriving a new class from an appropriate base class.
WPF provides a feature for customizing the appearance of your application. It allows you to set objects and values for things like fonts, backgrounds, etc.
The styles feature allows you to standardize on a specific look for the entire product. It allows you to replace the default appearance while retaining its default behavior.
Data template allows you to control the default visualization of the bound data.  With the help of themes, you can easily visualize styles from the operating system.
Layout helps you in proper positioning and sizing control. It is part of the process of composing the presentation for the user. The WPF framework eases the layout process and offers better adaptability of the UI appearance.
The layout infrastructure is offered by various classes are 1) StackPanel 2)DockPanel 3) WrapPanel 4) Grid and 5) Canvas
WPF provides an improved graphics system like
WPF framework offers three types of documents:
WPF enables better control over the print system. It includes remote printing and queues. Moreover, XPS documents can be printed directly without converting it into a print format.
WPF is a part of the .NET framework. It contains both managed and unmanaged code. The important components of WPF architecture are explained in the below-given figure:
Refer to this link to install WPF https://www.guru99.com/download-install-visual-studio.html

This scala tutorial covers all the aspects and topics of scala. You will learn all the fundamentals from scratch like What is scala, the Installation process of scala, Scala programs, Scala Functions, Lazy evaluation, Type interface, classes and objects, Inheritance, Abstractions, Java and scala differences, etc.
Scala is a statically typed programming language that incorporates both functional and object-oriented programming to increase scalability of applications. Scala primarily runs on JVM platform and it can also be used to write software for native platforms using Scala-Native and JavaScript runtimes through ScalaJs.
Scala is a Scalable Language used to write Software for multiple platforms. Hence, it got the name “Scala”. This language is intended to solve the problems of Java while simultaneously being more concise. Initially designed by Martin Odersky, it was released in 2003.
Here are the prime reasons for learning Scala Programming Language:
To begin writing Scala programs, you need to have it installed on your computer. In order to do this, you will need to visit their site https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ in order to download the latest version of Scala.
Following the link, we’re led to two options which we can choose to install Scala on our machines. For this Scala tutorial, we’ll download the IntelliJ IDEA.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="739" height="414" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori1.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Once you visit the download link, you’ll find two versions of the IntelliJ IDE.
For this Scala tutorial, we’ll download the Community Edition, which is free and comes with all you need to write Scala programs.
<img decoding="async" width="618" height="314" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori2.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 1)  Select Community Edition
On the page, click on the dropdown on the Community Edition.
It presents us with an option to download the IntelliJ IDE together with JBR which contains a JDK  implementation(Java Development Kit)  OpenJDK which Scala needs to compile and run the code.
<img decoding="async" width="441" height="448" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori3.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 2) Run the installation
Once you download IntelliJ, double click it in order to run the installation wizard and follow the dialog.
<img decoding="async" width="498" height="383" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori4.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 3) Select a location
Choose a location to install the IDE.
<img decoding="async" width="487" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori5.png" alt="How to install Scala">
If by chance you didn’t download the one with the JDK, we still get a prompt where that we can check to download it by selecting the checkbox.
<img decoding="async" width="497" height="379" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori6.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 4) Click on next
Leave the other defaults as they are and click next.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori7.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 5) Click on startup icon
Once the installation completes, run the IntelliJ IDE by clicking its startup icon in the startup menu like a regular application.
<img decoding="async" width="774" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori8.png" alt="How to install Scala">
You still need to go through an additional step of adding the Scala plugin to IntelliJ; you do so by clicking the dropdown on the configure menu located at the bottom right of the screen and selecting the plugin option.
<img decoding="async" width="593" height="617" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori9.png" alt="How to install Scala">
<img decoding="async" width="798" height="657" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori10.png" alt="How to install Scala">
On the Marketplace tab, a search for Scala will present the plugin as the first result under the Languages tag.
Step 6) Install Plugin
Click install, which will lead the plugin beginning the download.
<img decoding="async" width="317" height="305" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori11.png" alt="How to install Scala">
Step 7) Restart the IDE
After the download completes, you’ll be prompted to restart the IDE so that the installed plugin can start working.
<img decoding="async" width="253" height="321" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori12.png" alt="How to install Scala">
After restarting you’ll find yourself on the same page as before when we ran the IDE, but this time around we have already installed the Scala plugin.
Step 1) Select the Create Project option, which will lead us to a page where we can select the kind of language our project will be using.
<img decoding="async" width="774" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori13.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Step 2) choose Scala by selecting the Scala checkbox and click next.
<img decoding="async" width="685" height="713" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori14.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Step 3) Select a location to save our projects file and give our project a name.
<img decoding="async" width="701" height="106" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori15.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
If the directory doesn’t exist, IntelliJ will prompt us to ask us for permission to create the folder. Accept and click finish. You will be taken to your Scala project, which currently doesn’t have any Scala code.
It will take some time to load some indexes so don’t worry if you’re not able to immediately do anything while there’s a progress bar at the bottom of your IDE, it simply means your IDE is loading some files necessary to run Scala and help with IDE autocompletion.
Step 4) Next, we’ll click on the projects tab on the left of the IDE and expand so we can see the contents of our project.
<img decoding="async" width="490" height="281" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori16.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
At the moment the project is empty and only contains a .idea folder and hello-world.iml file generated by the IDE.  Our point of interest is the src folder.  Src is where we store the source code for our project. It’s where we’ll create our first Scala file.
Step 5) Right-click on src to open a menu to create a new Scala file.
<img decoding="async" width="667" height="322" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori17.png" alt="Create a new Scala file">
We will then create a name for the file, in this Scala tutorial we’ll use hello and then choose from a dropdown what to put as the content of the Scala file. Select “Object”
<img decoding="async" width="436" height="294" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori18.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Once we do this, we’ll have a Scala file that has a Singleton object that we’ll use to run our code.
<img decoding="async" width="456" height="256" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori19.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Now that you have a Scala file with a Hello object.  You will write your first program by extending the object you have created using the App keyword.
Extending our object with App tell the compiler which code to run when it starts your program. Immediately after extending App, a green arrow shows up on the left side, indicating that you can now be able to run your program.
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="109" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori20.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
<img decoding="async" width="298" height="123" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori21.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
Inside the Hello object, we write one function println() which is used to print the text inside it to the console. We will run our code by clicking on the green arrow.
Clicking the arrow presents us with the option Run, hello, upon clicking it, our code will start compiling and after some seconds we’ll see the results of our program printed from the console that’s inbuilt in the IntelliJ IDE.
<img decoding="async" width="488" height="515" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/071719_0712_ScalaTutori22.png" alt="Scala Hello World Program">
And there we go, we have successfully installed Scala and run our first program.
The Scala language has anonymous functions, which are also called function literals. Scala being a functional language often means developers break down large problems into many small tasks and create many functions to solve these problems. To make it easy to create functions, Scala contains these functions that can be instantiated without a name. We can assign them directly to variables or definitions ‘def’ as shown in the below Scala example:
We can then use the normal way we use functions by passing parameters to them follows.
These methods come in handy when we want to have a clean and concise code. We can use anonymous functions when defining methods that are not large and don’t require a lot of code in their body. They’re very simple and don’t need a ceremony to create.
These methods are not limited to functions with arguments and can be used to instantiate methods that don’t take in any arguments.
Most of these anonymous functions are used in other parts of our code where we need to create a quick function in place.
Another reason why these functions are also referred to as inline functions. Using anonymous functions is a common pattern which is used pervasively in the collections library to perform quick actions over a collection.
For instance, we have the filter method that takes an inline function/anonymous function to create another collection with only elements that meet the criteria we define in the anonymous function.
Here the methods we have as anonymous functions are the ones checking if the value we’re getting from the list is odd and even and returning the item.
In Scala, it’s also possible to use wildcards where our anonymous function’s parameter aren’t named. For example
In this scenario, we don’t name the parameter we’re passing in. The only thing we use an underscore to represent it.


Most languages sequentially evaluate variables and function parameters, one after the other. In Scala, we have a keyword called lazy, which helps in dealing with values we don’t want to be evaluated until they’re referenced.
A variable marked as lazy won’t be evaluated where it is defined, that’s commonly known as eager evaluation, it will only be evaluated when it’s referenced at some later in the code.
This can be helpful when evaluating a value might be an expensive computation, if it’s not the case that the value is always needed, we can save ourselves from running an expensive computation which can slow down our software by making our variable lazy.
This is not the only use case for lazy variables. They also help deal with issues of circular dependency in code.
In case the settings is false, we might not need to use myExpensiveValue, which can lead us to save us from doing an expensive computation which helps ensure that users have a nice time using our application as our their other needs can be properly computed without overwhelming the RAM.
In case the settings is false, we might not need to use myExpensiveValue, which can lead us to save us from doing an expensive computation which helps ensure that users have a nice time using our application as our their other needs can be computed appropriately without overwhelming the RAM.
The laziness also helps with function arguments, where the arguments are only used when they’re referenced inside the function. This concept is called Call-by-name parameters.
Many languages use the call-by-value way of evaluating arguments. The parameter passed through call-by-name will only be evaluated when needed in the function body and will not be evaluated before that. Once the value is evaluated, it is stored and can be reused later without it having to be re-evaluated. A concept which is known as memoization.
In Scala, you don’t have to declare types for every variable you create. This is because the Scala compiler can do type inference on types based on evaluation of the right-hand side. This allows your code to be more concise – it frees us from writing boilerplate where the expected type is obvious
A higher-order function is a function that can take functions as arguments and can return a function as a return type. In Scala, functions are considered first-class citizens. Using these functions this way enables us to be very flexible in the kind of programs we can make. We can create functions dynamically and feed in functionality dynamically to other functions.
In the above function, we pass in an int and a function that takes an int and returns an int. We can pass in any function of that signature. By signature, we mean a function’s input and output. A signature of Int=>Int means that a function takes an Int as input and returns an Int as its output.
A Signature of ()=>Int means that a function takes nothing as it’s input and returns an Int as its output. An example of a function like that would be one that generates a random int for us.
The above function has a signature ()=>Int
We can have a function that has a signature scala   ()=>Unit. This means the functions don’t take anything in and doesn’t return a type. The function could be doing some kind of computation by changing something to doing something predetermined.
These kinds of methods are not encouraged, though, as they seem to be a black box that can affect a system in some unknown ways. They’re also untestable. Having explicit input and output types enable us to reason about what our function does.
A higher-order function can also return a function.
For example, we could create a method that will create a powering function, i.e., takes a number and applies power to it.
The above function takes an int. Our return type is an anonymous function that takes an Int x, * we use the int x as the argument for the power function.
In Scala, we can convert a function that takes two arguments into one that takes one argument at a time. When we pass in one argument, we partially apply it and end up with a function that takes one argument to complete the function. Currying enables us to create functions by partially adding some arguments.
This can be useful for creating functions dynamically before we have a complete set of arguments
If we need to create a function that multiplies by some specific number, we don’t need to create another multiplication method.
We can simply call the .curried on our function above and get a function that takes one argument first and return a partially applied function
Scala has a powerful inbuilt mechanism for helping us check a whether a variable matches up to certain criteria, much like we would do in a switch statement in Java or in a series of if/else statements. The language has pattern matching that we can use to check whether a variable is of a particular type. Pattern matching in Scala is powerful and can be used destructure the components that have an unapply method in order to get fields we’re interested in directly from the variable we’re matching.
Scala’s pattern matching also provides a more pleasant syntax compared to switch statement.
We compare our variable to a set of options, and when the variable we’re matching up meets the criteria, the expression on the right-hand side of the fat arrow (=>) evaluates and is returned as the result of the match.
We use an underscore to catch cases that are unmatched in our code. It mirrors the behavior of the default case when dealing with switch statements.
In the code above, you are able to find out the type of the myItem variable and based on that branch off to some specific code.
Pattern matching checks whether the variable matches
The underscore works as a placeholder that matches any other condition that is not matched by the other items in the case statements above.  We take a variable myItem and call the match method.
With Case classes, we can even go further and destructure the class to get fields inside the object.
By using the sealed keyword to define our classes, we get the benefit of having the compiler exhaustively check the cases we try to match against and warn us if we forget to handle a particular one.
It’s possible to create values that can’t be changed by other functions in Scala using the val keyword. This is achieved in Java by using the final keyword. In Scala, we do so by using a val keyword when creating a variable instead of using var, which is the alternative we would use to create a mutable variable.
A variable defined using the val keyword is read-only, whereas one defined with var can be read and be changed by other functions or arbitrarily by the user in the code.
Trying to assign a value to myNumber after we’ve declared it as a val throws a compile-time error or “reassignment to val.”
Immutability helps us prevent code and other programmers from changing our values unexpectedly, which would lead to unexpected results if they are intended to use the value we store they can instead make a copy of it. This way, bugs that can be caused by multiple actors changing the same variable are prevented.
We all know that objects are the real-world entities, and class is a template that defines objects. Classes have both state and behaviors. The states are either values or variables.  The behaviors are the methods in Scala.
Let us look into how you can define a class, instantiate it, and use it using Scala.
Here, the class called Rectangle, which has two variables and two functions. You can also use the parameters l and b directly as fields in the program. You have an object which has a main method and has instantiated the class with two values.
Example:
All the fields and method are by default public in Scala. It is essential to use override because toString method is defined for Object in Scala.
Scala has multiple types of inheritance (like single, multi-level, multiple, hierarchical, hybrid,) that share a lot in common with traditional forms found in Java. You can inherit both from classes and traits. You can inherit the members of one class into another class using the keyword “extends”. This enables reusability.
It’s possible to inherit from one class or multiple classes. It’s also possible to inherit from subclasses that themselves have their superclasses, creating a hierarchy of inheritance in the process.
In the below Scala example, the Base class is Circle, and derived class is Sphere. A circle has a value called radius, which is inherited in the Sphere class. The method calcArea is overridden using the keyword override.
Example:
In Scala, we can create abstract methods and member fields using abstract classes and traits.  Inside abstract classes and traits, we can define abstract fields without necessarily implementing them.
Example:
These fields are implemented by the classes that extend the trait or abstract class. You can use traits to create contracts as to what our application should be able to do and then implement those methods later.
This way, we can plan out how our application will look like without implementing the methods which can help us envision how various methods will look like. It follows along a pattern know as programming to abstractions and not the actual implementation.
The class which is prefaced with keyword abstract can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. But, multiple inheritances is not supported in abstract class. So, you can extend at most one abstract class.
A Singleton is a class that is only instantiated once in a program. It’s from a popular and useful programming pattern known as the “singleton pattern”. It’s useful in creating instances that are meant to be long-living and will be commonly accessed throughout your program whose state is integral in coordinating the events of a system. Creating such a class in Scala is easy as Scala provides us with a simple means of creating singletons using the object keyword.
We can then reference this object throughout our program with the guarantee that all parts of our program will see the same data as there’s only one instance of it.
The concept of static members is not there in Scala, that is the reason you need to use singleton objects, which act like static members of a class.
Implicit classes are the new functionality added after version 2.1. It is primarily to add new functionality to the closed classes.
The implicit keyword should be defined in a class, object, or trait. The primary constructor of an implicit class should have exactly one argument in its first parameter list. It may also include an additional implicit parameter list.
In the below Scala example, new functionality to replace vowels of a String with * is added.
You need to import in the class where you are  using it.
In OOP programs are constructed by grouping data and the functions that operate on that data into highly connected units. Objects carry their data in the fields and methods that operate on them.  In this style of programming, the main abstraction is the data as the methods that are created are meant to operate on the data.
Functional programming, on the other hand, separates data and the functions that operate on the data. This enables developers to treats functions as the abstraction and driving force when modeling programs.
Scala enables functional programming by having functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as values to other functions and returned as values as well. The combination of these two paradigms has made Scala a great choice in building complex software in various industries, such as Data Science.
Here, are some important frameworks of Scala
Scala has some of the best concurrency libraries in the Java ecosystem.
Here are the main difference between Java and Scala.
In this tutorial, you have learned how to get started with Scala. You have also learned the functional and object-oriented features. You have also discovered the similarities and differences between Java and Scala. This tutorial should have helped you with a wide variety of examples that are well demonstrated.

The modern web application has really come a long way over the years with the introduction of many popular frameworks such as bootstrap, Angular JS, etc. All of these frameworks are based on the popular JavaScript framework.
But when it came to developing server-based applications, there was a kind of void, and this is where Node.js came into the picture.
Node.js is also based on the JavaScript framework, but it is used for developing server-based applications. While going through the entire tutorial, we will look into Node.js in detail and how we can use it to develop server-based applications.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment used for the development of server-side web applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run on a wide variety of operating systems.
Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking Input/Output API that is designed to optimize an application’s throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.
Over a long period of time, the framework available for web development were all based on a stateless model. A stateless model is where the data generated in one session (such as information about user settings and events that occurred) is not maintained for usage in the next session with that user.
A lot of work had to be done to maintain the session information between requests for a user. But with Node.js, there is finally a way for web applications to have real-time two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely.
We will have a look into the real worth of Node.js in the coming chapters, but what is it that makes this framework so famous. Over the years, most of the applications were based on a stateless request-response framework. In these sort of applications, it is up to the developer to ensure the right code was put in place to ensure the state of web session was maintained while the user was working with the system.
But with Node.js web applications, you can now work in real-time and have a 2-way communication. The state is maintained, and either the client or server can start the communication.
Let’s look at some of the key features of Node.js
Node.js is used by many large companies. Below is a list of a few of them.
Node.js is best for usage in streaming or event-based real-time applications like
Node.js is good when you need high levels of concurrency but less amount of dedicated CPU time.
Best of all, since Node.js is built on javascript, it’s best suited when you build client-side applications which are based on the same javascript framework.
Node.js can be used for a lot of applications with various purposes. The only scenario where it should not be used is where there are long processing times, which is required by the application.
Node is structured to be single-threaded. If an application is required to carry out some long-running calculations in the background, it won’t be able to process any other requests. As discussed above, Node.js is used best where processing needs less dedicated CPU time.

The course is designed for SQL beginners. No prior DB experience is required.
MariaDB
A database management system (DBMS) is a software used to store and manage data. It guarantees the quality, durability, and confidentiality of information. The most popular type of DBMS are  Relational Database Management Systems, or RDBMSs. Here,  the database consists of a structured set of tables and each row of a table is a record.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for data manipulation in a DBMS. In in simple words its used to talk to the data in a DBMS. Following are types of SQL Statements
A Query is a set of instruction given to the database management system. It tells any database what information you would like to get from the database. For example, to fetch the student name from the database table STUDENT, you can write the SQL Query like this:
When you want to execute an SQL command for any DBMS system, you need to find the best method to carry out your request, and SQL engine determines how to interpret that specific task.
Important  components included in this SQL process are:
A classic query engine allows you to manage all the non-SQL queries.

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Perl is a term stands for “Practical Extraction and Reporting Language” even though there is no acronym for Perl. It was introduced by Larry Wall in 1987. Perl language was specially designed for text editing. But now, it is widely used for a variety of purposes including Linux system administration, network programming, web development, etc.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="576" height="345" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1135_Introductio4.png" alt="Programming Languages Overview" border="0">		
Let’s put it in a simple manner. While computers understand just 0’s and 1’s (binary language/machine language/ [low-level language]), it is very difficult to program in a binary language for us human. Perl is a programming language which uses natural language elements, words that are used in common English language and is, therefore, easier to understand by humans [high-level language]. Now there’s a problem; computers cannot understand high-level languages, which we humans can easily understand. For that, we need something which can translate the high-level language to low-level language. Here interpreter comes to our help. The interpreter is a piece of software which converts the program written in the high-level language to low-level language for the computer to understand and execute the instructions written in the program. Hence, Perl is an interpreted programming language.
The power of Perl scripting language can be implemented in many fields. The most popular use of Perl is in Web development., Perl is also used to automate many tasks in the Web servers, and other administration jobs, it can automatically generate emails and clean up systems. Perl is still used for its original purpose i.e. extracting data and generating reports. It can produce reports on resource use and check for security issues in a network. Due to this reason, Perl has become a popular language used in web development, networking and bioinformatics too. Apart from all this perl can also be used for CGI programming.
Perl can also be utilized for image creation & manipulation. Apart from that networking via telnet, FTP, etc., Graphical User Interface creation, VLSI electronics & to create mail filters to reduce spamming practices are some use cases of Perl.
Perl is also known for implementation of OOP(object oriented programming) practices and supports all forms of inheritance (simple, multiple & diamond), polymorphism and encapsulation. Perl is flexible enough to support Procedural as well as OOP practices simultaneously. Perl also has extra modules which permit you to write or use/reuse code written in Python, PHP, PDL, TCL, Octave, Java, C, C++, Basic, Ruby and Lua in your Perl script. This means that you can combine Perl with these extra programming languages rather rewriting existing code.



Applications of Perl Programming Language


It is true that there are other programming languages that can be used to do all the stuff that has been stated above, then why should you specifically use Perl? Perl is very easy to learn, especially if you have a background in computer programming. Perl was designed to be easy for humans to write and understand rather than making it easy for processing by computers. It uses regular expressions. It’s natural style of language is different from other programming languages that use specific grammar and syntaxes; therefore, Perl is very flexible and doesn’t impose on you any particular way of thinking out a solution or a problem. Perl is extremely portable. It can run on any operating system that has Perl interpreter installed, so it is platform independent. All Linux Operating Systems come installed with Perl, so you can start Perl coding in Linux out of the box. This is unlike Shell scripts, where the code changes with the flavor of Linux distribution being used, making it less and less portable Small specific tasks in Perl become very easy and quick. Throughout this Perl tutorial for beginners, you will learn how you can code small, quick programs for specific tasks. Let’s take a simple example of the classic Hello World program which is used to begin learning any programming language which has UNIX as its roots: 
<img decoding="async" width="364" height="386" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1135_Introductio6.png" alt="Simple Example of Perl" border="0">		
Output:
Hello, world!
The above two lines of code will print Hello, world! Now wasn’t it too simple and quick? Students with knowledge of C, C++ will know that it requires many more lines of code to obtain the same output in those languages.  
You might be wondering why Perl is so famous on the Web. It is simple as most of the things that happen on the web are of TEXT and Perl is very good at text processing. If we compare Perl with any of the languages, then Perl will be the best language which is good in File handling, text processing, and output reporting
One of the best advantages of Perl is that it is free to use		
The Perl community strongly believes that software should be freely available, freely modifiable and freely distributable. Several volunteers from Perl community strive to make the programming language as good as possible.

With enough knowledge about the history of Perl and basic concepts of computer programming required for coding in Perl, it is time we take the dive and get started with Perl. The next chapter will teach you how you can setup Perl on your system and get ready for the coding journey in Perl. This Perl scripting tutorial will take Linux as the OS which students will be using for coding in Perl.
Good news you probably have it!		
But if you can’t find it already on your system, you can still get it for free.
To find out if you already have Perl installed, go into the command line and type: perl -v

The command will display version of Perl if it’s installed. In this case, the version is v5.14.2. But if not… don’t panic…

If you need to update the Perl version then just enter one single line of command
sudo apt-get install perl		
and relax. The rest will be taken care of. Just make sure you have an active internet connection.

First, download the Active Perl from this link. Follow these steps to install ActivePerl on Windows system. See the below screenshots for the same.
Step 1: Once you download the installer and start the installation you will see the below window, click on next to proceed.
<img decoding="async" width="505" height="386" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1141_SettingUpan10.png" alt="How to install Perl on Windows" border="0">		
Step 2: Accept Licensing agreement to proceed the installation.

There are lots of things which needs to be discussed for setting Perl environment in both Linux and Windows, as there won’t be many library files included in this installation. You need to manually install those. You can install those manually using CPAN(Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) or either PPM which works only for perl windows. But these files are not mandatory to start coding in Perl. 
Apart from this windows setup you could use Windows 10’s new feature of Linux subsystem over windows & use it for running perl code
First Perl Program
Don’t worry if you don’t understand this text. Everything will be clear soon. Come on and take a look at it by line:
This tells the Operating System to execute this file with the program located at /usr/bin/perl  Some IDEs don’t need this line. If it’s essential, you must write here a path to your interpreter. Remember! This special line must be at the beginning of your program and must starts from #! use warnings; This is another special command which tells the interpreter to display any warnings i.e.  -w which activates warnings globally.
The print instruction writes text to the screen. The semicolon at the end of the line tells the perl interpreter that the instruction is finished. You must put a semicolon at the end of every instruction in Perl code. Note the quotation mark(“). It’s necessary for print instruction. Save the above script as firstprog.pl
If you have Strawberry installed, you can simply click on Run. You can also run command-line interface and write on the console:
or, if perl.exe is not in your path:
You just have to open the Terminal and write:
If you can’t run the program, make sure you have eligibility to run it. Type in the Terminal:
Your program is now executable and ready to run. To execute, write:
Modules are set of codes that are used to do tasks that perform common operations in several programs. If you use perl modules, you do not have to rewrite the codes to perform that same operation. Perl can make use of such external libraries of codes. One of the best libraries is the CPAN. It stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and contains a vast amount of Perl modules for you to use. It is a community or network of a large number of developers who contribute such modules. By installing support for CPAN modules in your perl module, you can make use of the CPAN modules and make your work easier. Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use XS (they are written in C) so require a C compiler (it’s easy to get this setup – don’t panic. Modules may have dependencies on other modules (almost always on CPAN) and cannot be installed without them (or without a specific version of them). It is worth thoroughly reading the documentation for the options below. Many modules on CPAN now require a recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above). Install cpanminus a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN to make installing other modules easier (you’ll thank us later). To Install App-cpanminus perl modules, in the command line type:
cpan App::cpanminus Make sure you have internet connection while perl modules are being downloaded and installed.

Now install any module:
Let’s see an example of installing a module File::Data(It’s an Interface to access File Data).
<img decoding="async" width="601" height="193" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071713_1141_SettingUpan18.png" alt="Installing cpan minus modules" border="0">		
Now, we’ll talk about variables. You can imagine variable like kind of container which holds one or more values. Once defined, the name of variable remains the same, but the value or values change over and over again. 



Types of Variables in Perl


The easiest ones are scalars, and this is ours today subject
This type of variable holds a single value.
Its name begins with a dollar sign and a Perl identifier (it’s the name of our variable).



Scalar variable in Perl


If you are familiar with other programming languages, then you would know that there are certain rules about naming variables. Similarly, Perl has three rules for naming scalars.
Perl Example:		
These, however, are not legal scalar variable names.
The general rule says, when Perl has just one of something, that’s a scalar. Scalars can be read from devices, and we can use it to our programs.
In this type of scalar data we could specify:
<img decoding="async" width="113" height="108" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/7-19-2013-5-36-53-PM.png" alt="Number variables in Perl" border="0">		
Notice: In general, Perl interpreter sees integers like floating points numbers. For example, if you write 2 in your programs, Perl will see it like 2.0000
It consists of one or more digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus and containing underscores.
Perl Examples:		
As you can see- it’s nothing special. But believe me, this is the most common type of scalars. They’re everywhere.
It consists of digits, optionally minus, decimal point and exponent.
Perl Examples:		
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="274" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071813_1105_Perlvariabl7.png" alt="Floating-point literals in Perl" border="0">		
It’s alternative to the decimal system. Allow me to show you Octal, Hexadecimal and Binary representation. A short table presents all important information about this weird styles:
Perl Examples:		
All of these values for Perl means the same. Perl doesn’t store the values in the same format. It will internally convert these hexadecimal, binary, octal to decimal values. 
The assignment is the most common operation on a scalar, and it’s very simple. Perl uses for that equal sign. It takes a value of the expression from the right side and puts this value to our variable.
Let’s take a look to examples:		
What’s more you can put in variable not only a number, but also an expression.		
Strings: It’s also very simple type of scalar.
The maximum length of a string in Perl depends upon the amount of memory the computer has. There is no limit to the size of the string, any amount of characters, symbols, or words can make up your strings. The shortest string has no characters. The longest can fill all of the system memory. Perl programs can be written entirely in 7-bit ASCII character set. Perl also permits you to add any 8-bit or 16-bit character set aka. non-ASCII characters within string literals. Perl has also added support for Unicode UTF-8. 
<img decoding="async" width="128" height="231" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/7-19-2013-5-41-16-PM.png" alt="Types of strings in Perl" border="0">		
Like numbers there are two different types of strings:
Single quotation marks are used to enclose data you want to be taken literally. A short example and everything should be clear:
Perl Examples:		
Output:
it is $num
Here due to single quotes value of $num in not taken and the literal characters ‘$’,’n’, ‘u’ & ‘m’ are added to the value of $txt
Double quotation marks are used to enclose data that needs to be interpolated before processing. That means that escaped characters and variables aren’t simply literally inserted into later operations, but are evaluated on the spot. Escape characters can be used to insert newlines, tabs, etc.
Perl Examples:		
Output:
it is 7
Here due to double quotes value of $num is taken added to the value of $txt
Double-quotes interpolate scalar and array variables, but not hashes. On the other hand, you can use double-quotes to interpolate slices of both arrays and hashes.
Mysterious \n
Consider the following program
Perl Examples:		
Output:
hello
Perl does not display just ‘hello\n’, but only ‘hello’. Why? Because ‘\n’ is a special sign and means that you want to go to a new line while displaying the text in your program. print “hello\n new line”; Next question- are there any other special sign? Yes, they are! But don’t worry- just a few. Check the table below
I know, there isn’t ‘just a few’… But believe me, you must to know just
It’s the same operation, which we see in numbers assignment. Perl gets our string from the right side of the equal sign and puts this string to a variable.
Perl Examples:		
Output:
tutorial315
As you can see, you can put numbers and strings in the same variables. There isn’t class of variables.
The concatenation operator “.” unites two or more strings. Remember! If the string contains quotes, carriage returns, backslashes, all these special characters need to be escaped with a backslash. 
Perl ‘ ‘ variable Examples:		
Output:
Tom is mother’s favorite cat
The strings
“$a”, “$b”, is concatenated & stored in “$c” using the “.” operator.		
In the end…
As you know, Perl automatically converts between numbers to string as needed. How does Perl know, what we need right now? This is simple- everything depends on the operator (we’ll talk about operators later, now, just accept there are a lot of operators, different for numbers and strings) If an operator expects a number, Perl will use the value as a number. If an operator expects a string, Perl will use the value as a string. In other words- you don’t need to worry about this kind of conversion. Short example and everything should be clear:
Perl Examples:		
Output:
71
the value of $string is converted to an integer and added to the value of $number.
The result of the addition, 71, is assigned to $result.		
Scope of a variable – Access Modifiers
We can declare a scalar in anywhere in the program. But you need to specify an access modifier
My: Using this you can declare any variable which is specific within the block. i.e. within the curly braces.
No Output
The output of the program will be nothing!
<img decoding="async" width="294" height="144" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071813_1105_Perlvariabl15.png" alt="PERL Tutorial for Beginners - Complete Guide" border="0">		
In the above example, you will see that there are two variables declared one is inside if block ($var_2) and the other is outside the If block ($var). The variable, which is declared outside the block will be accessible to if block but the variable which was declared inside if block won’t be accessible to the outer program.
Local: Using this we can actually mask the same variable values to different values without actually changing the original value of the variable, suppose we have a variable $a for which the value is assigned 5, you can actually change the value of that variable by re-declaring the same variable using local keyword without altering the original value of the variable which is 5. Let’s see how this works with an example.
The output of the above program will be in this manner.
local, $var = 3		
global, $var = 5		
This way we can change the value of the variable without affecting the original value.
Our: Once a variable is declared with access modifier “our” it can be used across the entire package. Suppose, you have Perl module or a package test.pm which has a variable declared with scope our. This variable can be accessed in any scripts which will use that package.
If you are serious about programming in Perl, you should begin your program with
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
This will help you write better and cleaner code. ‘use strict’ turns on strict pragma which will make you declare your variables with my keyword.
This is a good programming practice
Result: Error
Output:
10
An Array is a special type of variable which stores data in the form of a list; each element can be accessed using the index number which will be unique for each and every element. You can store numbers, strings, floating values, etc. in your array. This looks great, So how do we create an array in Perl? In Perl, you can define an array using ‘@’ character followed by the name that you want to give. Let’s consider defining an array in Perl.
my @array;
This is how we define an array in Perl; you might be thinking how we need to store data in it. There are different ways of storing data in an array. This depends on how you are going to use it.
Output:
abcd
This is an array with 4 elements in it.
The array index starts from 0 and ends to its maximum declared size, in this case, the max index size is 3.



Perl Array Example


You can also declare an array in the above way; the only difference is, it stores data into an array considering a white space to be the delimiter. Here, qw() means quote word. The significance of this function is to generate a list of words. You can use the qw in multiple ways to declare an array.
Output:
abcdpqrsvxyz
Suppose you want to assign a value to the 5th element of an array, how are we going to do that.
$array [4] =’e’;
Sequential arrays are those where you store data sequentially. Suppose, you want to store 1-10 numbers or alphabets a-z in an array. Instead of typing all the letters, you can try something like below –
Output:
12345678910
We have an array which is already available, and you don’t know what the size of that array is, so what is the possible way to find that.
Can we get the size of an array without using functions? Yes, we can.
Output:
5
5
The above method of declaring an array is called static arrays, where you know the size of an array.
 What is Dynamic Array?		
Dynamic arrays are those that you declare without specifying any value on them. So when exactly do we store values in that array? Simple, we store them during run time. Here is a simple program for that.
We will be using some inbuilt Perl functions for doing this task.
Output:
This is 
kind of dyn 
mic 
rr 
y
The split function splits the content of string into an array based on the delimiter provided to it. This function will also eliminate the delimiter from the string, in this case, it is ‘a’;
These functions can be used in Perl to add/delete to array elements.
<img decoding="async" width="515" height="200" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0537_Arrays4.png" alt="Array functions in Perl" border="0">		
Output:
1st : Mon Tue Wed
2nd when push : Mon Tue Wed Thu
3rd when unshift : Fri Mon Tue Wed Thu
4th when pop : Fri Mon Tue Wed
5th when shift : Mon Tue Wed
We already learned about scalars and arrays in previous sections.
What exactly scalars do? It only stores integers and strings.
What exactly arrays do? It is a collection of scalars, where you access each element of an array using indices. But, is this good idea to use an array when you have hundreds and thousands of records? We will forget which index has what value. To overcome this situation we have something like perl hash.
A hash can also hold as many scalars as the array can hold. The only difference is we don’t have any index rather we have keys and values. A hash can be declared, starting with % followed by the name of the hash. Let’s see an example how we can define a Perl hash and how we can differentiate this from array
Consider an example of three people and their ages are represented in an array.
Output:
Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25
This way it is difficult to know individual ages as we need to remember both index locations of name and age of all the people. It may be simple when you have 3 names, but when you have 1000 or more? You know the answer.
<img decoding="async" width="460" height="312" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0921_PerlHashes2.png" alt="Hashes in Perl" border="0">	
This we can overcome using a hash.
Hash Example:
Output:
Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25Sainath33Krishna24Shruthi25
We have now declared a hash, great!! But, how do we access or print it? Each element in hash should be accessed with its associated key for which there will be a value assigned. So, there is a one-one mapping between each of the key and value in the hash.
In order to print the age of any person, you just need to remember the name of that person.
You might have wondered why I used $hash{KeyName}, remember a hash is a collection of scalars again. So, we can use $ which represents scalar to access each hash element.
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="331" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0921_PerlHashes3.png" alt="Example of Hash in Perl" border="0">		
Note: Each Key in hash should be unique or else it will override your value, which was assigned previously.
How can we assign a hash to another hash? Simple, same way as we do for 
We can also print entire hash.
Output:
Tom23
As you can see we already have a hash %newHash, and now we need to add more entries into it.
Output:
Jim25John26Harry27
You may want to delete an entry from a hash. This is how we can do that.
Delete is an inbuilt function of Perl. Here, we will see an example of assigning a hash to an array.
Note: Whenever you print a hash or when you store hash into an array. The order may always differ. It’s not the same always.
We can assign only keys or values of a hash to an array.
To remove all the entries in the hash, we can directly assign the hash to null.
%newHash=();# This will redefine the hash with no entries.
We can use conditional Statements in Perl. So, what are conditional statements? Conditional statements are those, where you actually check for some circumstances to be satisfied in your code.
Think about an example, you are buying some fruits, and you don’t like the price to be more than 100 bucks. So, the rule here is 100 bucks.
Perl supports two types of conditional statements; they are if and unless.
If code block will be executed, when the condition is true.
<img decoding="async" width="374" height="232" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_0932_Conditional1.png" alt="Perl Conditional Statements" border="0">		
Output:
5
This looks good. Let us think about a situation where $a is not 5.
Output:
The value is 10 —FAIL			
This way we can control only one condition at a time. Is it a limitation? No, you can also control various conditions using if… elsif … else.
Output:
Executed elsif block –The value is 5
In the above case, the elsif block will be executed as $a is equal to 5.
There could be situations where both if and elsif code blocks will be failed. In this scenario, the else code block will be executed. You can actually eliminate the else code check if you don’t like to include.
In this case, you can use if code block in one more if code block.
Output:
Inside 1st else block – The value is 11
Execute the same code by change the value of $a; you can find out the rest.		
You have already got an idea what if does (If the condition is true it will execute the code block). Unless is opposite to if, unless code block will be executed if the condition is false.
Output:
Inside 1st else block – The value is 5
Guess what will be the output. You are right!!!!!. The output will be the print statement of the else block. Because of the condition in unless code block is true, remember unless block will be executed only if the condition is false. Change the value of $a and execute the code you will see the difference.
Output:
Inside else block
Output:
Inside unless Block
Perl supports control structures similar to other programming languages. Perl supports four types of control structures for, foreach, while and until. We use these statements to, repeatedly execute some code.
For code block will execute till the condition is satisfied. Let’s take an example of how to Perl loop an array.
Output:
The array index 0 value is 1
The array index 1 value is 2
The array index 2 value is 3
The array index 3 value is 4
The array index 4 value is 5
The array index 5 value is 6
The array index 6 value is 7
The array index 7 value is 8
The array index 8 value is 9
The array index 9 value is 10
Here, in for () expression, there are many statements included. There is a meaning for each of them.
Here is another way of using for.
Output:
1n
 2n
 3n
 4n
  5n
  6n
  7n
 8n
  9n
  10n
The for each statement can be used in the same way as for; the main difference is we don’t have any condition check and incrementing in this.
Let’s take the same example with foreach perl.
Output:
The value is 1
 The value is 2
 The value is 3
The value is 4
 The value is 5
 The value is 6
 The value is 7
  The value is 8
 The value is 9
 The value is 10
Foreach takes each element of an array and assigns that value to $var for every iteration. We can also use $_ for the same.
Output:
The value is 1
 The value is 2
 The value is 3
The value is 4
 The value is 5
 The value is 6
 The value is 7
  The value is 8
 The value is 9
 The value is 10
This looks good for accessing arrays. How about Hashes, how can we obtain hash keys and values using foreach?
We can use foreach to access keys and values of the hash by looping it.
<img decoding="async" width="227" height="230" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_1015_PerlControl2.png" alt="For loop in Perl" border="0">		
Output:
Mickey
Tom
Jerry
You might be wondering, Why we used Keys in foreach(). Keys is an inbuilt function of Perl where we can quickly access the keys of the hash. How about values? We can use values function for accessing values of the hash.
Output:
the value is 24
 the value is 23 
the value is 25 
The Perl While loop is a control structure, where the code block will be executed till the condition is true.
The code block will exit only if the condition is false.
Let’s take an example for Perl While loop.
<img decoding="async" width="265" height="265" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/071913_1015_PerlControl4.png" alt="While loop in Perl" border="0">		
Here is a problem, which will require input from the user and will not exit until the number provided as ‘7’.
Output:
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
9
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
 5
Guess a Number Between 1 and 10
 7
You guessed the lucky number 7
In the above example, the while condition will not be true if we enter input other than ‘7’.
If you see how while works here, the code block will execute only if the condition in a while is true.
Do while loop will execute at least once even if the condition in the while section is false.
Let’s take the same example by using do while.
Output:
10 
  9
  8 
 7 
  6 
  5 
  4 
  3 
  2 
  1 
  Now value is less than 1
Until code block is similar to unless in a conditional statement. Here, the code block will execute only if the condition in until block is false.  
Let’s take the same example which we used in case of a while.
Here is a problem, which will require input from the user and will not exit until the name provided as other than ‘sai’.
Output:
Enter any name sai
Do until can be used only when we need a condition to be false, and it should be executed at-least once.
Output:
Enter any name Howard
Enter any name Sheldon
Enter any name sai
Execute while, do-while, until and do-until example codes to see the difference.
Operators in computer language indicate an action that can be performed on some set of variables or values which computer can understand. Perl has incorporated most of the Operators from C language. Perl has many operators compared with other programming languages. Operators are categorized as Arithmetic, Logical, relational and assignment operators.
Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are those which can be used to perform some basic mathematic operations. These Arithmetic operators are binary operators where we need two arguments to perform a basic operation. We can also use unary operators for other basic operations; you can see the difference in examples below.
+
Addition operation used for adding two values or variables
holding values
$x=5+6; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x+$y;
–
Subtraction operator used for subtracting two values or variables holding values
$x=6-5; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x-$y;
*
Multiplication operator used for multiply two values or variables holding values
$x=6*5; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x*$y;
/
Division operator used for divide two values or variables holding values
$x=36/6; # or
$y=6;
$z=$x/$y;
**
The exponential operator used for provide exponent and get the value.
Ex : 22 = 4, 33 = 27
$x=5**5; # or
$x=4;
$y=2;
$z=$x**$y;
%
Modulus operator used to get the reminder during division of two values or variables holding values
$x=5%2; # or
$x=10;
$y=2;
$z=$x % $y;
++
Unary addition operator to increment value of a variable by 1
$x=5;
$x++;
Or
++$x;
—
Unary Subtraction operator to decrement value of a variable by 1
$x=5;
$x–; # post decrement
Or
–$x;# pre decrement
Example to complete all the above operations.
Output:
Add of 10 and 2 is 12
Sub of 10 and 2 is 8
Mul of 10 and 2 is 20
Div of 10 and 2 is 5
Exp of 10 and 2 is 100
Mod of 10 and 2 is 0
Assignment operators simply assign values to variables, but there is one more thing which we need to remember here, assignment operators will also perform arithmetic operations and assign the new value to the same variable on which the operation is performed.
+=
Addition operator used for adding and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x+=10;
-=
Subtraction operator used for subtracting and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x-=10;
*=
Multiplication operator used for adding and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x*=10;
/=
Division operator used for dividing and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x/=10;
**=
Exponential operator used for getting exponent and assigning the value to same variable
$x=4;
$x**=10;
%=
Modulus operator used for getting a reminder during division and assigning the value to the same variable
$x=10;
$x%=4;
Example to complete all the above operations.
Output:
Add = 15
Sub= 10
Mul = 50
Div = 10
Perl uses logical operators to compare numbers and strings. Most of the time logical operators are used in Conditional Statements.



Logical and Relational Operators in Perl


==or eq
Operator used to check whether both variables are equal
!=Or ne
Operator used to check whether both variables are not equal
> or gt
Operator used to check whether
A is greater than B
<or lt
Operator used to check whether
A is less than B
>=or ge
Operator used to check whether
A is greater than or equal to B
<=or le
Operator used to check whether
A is less than or equal to B
|| or or
Operator used to check either A or B is holding value
&&or and
Operator used to check both A and B is holding value
Let us take an example where we can explain all the scenarios.
Output:
True — equal 5 and 5
  True — not equal 6 and 7
  True — 7 greater than 6
  True — 6 less than 7
  True — 6 less than 7
 True — 7 greater than 6
You can see examples of logical operators in later sections.
Special variables in Perl are those who have some predefined meaning. These variables denoted with either real Name or Punctuation symbols. We have a special variable for all the Perl supported Variables like scalar special variables, Array special variables, hash special variables. Most of the special variables that we use are of scalars.
When we want to use the special variable with its name, then we have to load a Perl module ‘use English,’ to explicitly say Perl interpreter that we are going to use special variables using its Name.
$_$ARG
This is the default variable which stores the current values.
$0 or $PROGRAM_NAME

The input record separator, this has a default value of ‘\n’ which is newline character
$.
Holds the current line number of the file that is being read
$,
Output field separator, this is mainly used by the print() statement. By default value of this is set to 0, we can change the value of this variable.
$\
Output record separator, the value of this variable will be empty; we can assign any value to this, which will be used by print() statement while printing the output.

Perl regular expression is strong enough in matching the string patterns within a statements or group of statements. Regular expressions are mostly used in text parsing, pattern matching and much more based on the requirement. We have certain operators, which are specially used by regular expression pattern binding =~ and !~, These are test and assignment operators.



Regular Expression Operators in Perl


Before going further, We need to know few things about regular expression; there are certain things like Meta characters, wildcards in Perl Regex syntax.
\
Special or quote
*
Match 0 or more characters
+
Match 1 or more characters
?
Match 0 or 1 character
|
Can be used to match alternative patterns
()
Used to store the pattern matched
[]
Set of characters can be passed. Specifically used for numeric and alphabets.
{}
Used for providing the number of time the match can be performed.
^
Start of the string
$
End of string
\w
Used to match a single character or word which can be alphanumeric including “_”
\W
Match anything other than alphanumeric
\s
Used to match whitespaces
\S
Match anything other than whitespace
\d
Match numbers. Not decimal values and negative values
\D
Match anything other than numbers.
\t
Match tab space
\n
Match newline
The above are the set of characters which can be used during pattern matching.
Let’s see few examples.
Consider a situation where user provides some input during script execution, and we want to check whether the user entered some name as input or not. We have to write a regular expression syntax to extract your name and print the same.
Output:
Found Pattern
Here, we have written the regular expression as /.*(Guru99).*/.* match all characters in a string. A ‘.’ in perl regex match refers to any character including space.
Let us see how exactly we can construct a Regex.
Consider an example of a string of multiple words and digits and special symbols like this “Hello everyone this is my number: +91-99298373639”;
Regex : /^\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\s\w+\:\+\d+\-\d+/i 
Word space word space word space word space word space word space special character : space special character+digits special character –digits.
The match operators are used to match a string within some statement or in a variable.
Output:
true
This small code will print ‘true’, as the perl pattern matching identifies the string in a variable. Basically, Perl searches for the text provided in // throughout the string, even if it finds in one place it will return ‘true’. The pattern can be anywhere in the variable. We can try replacing =~ with !~ to see the difference between those two operators.
This operator can be used for searching and replacing any character with either null or some other character.
Output:
cello how are you
Note: We can actually use any pattern matching string as we did earlier in this substitution operator as well. Here we used ‘gi’, g-globally, i-ignore case.
This is similar to Substitution, but it does not use any perl regular expressions, rather we can directly pass the value or a word which we want to replace.
Output:
Hello cow are you
Perl was designed to manipulate files and I/O operations effectively. Perl main advantage is in file parsing and handling the files. There are many inbuilt functions and operators used during file handling in Perl.
Basically, file operations that are performed with Perl are done using FILEHANDLE. We have to define this FILEHANDLE during the opening a file for either read or write.
In this Perl script tutorial, you will learn-		
We can open a file using open() function available in Perl.
Now we have opened a file, now a question arises. Is it for reading or writing?
Perl has certain modes, which need to be used to read, write or append a file.
Few examples for reading a file:
<img decoding="async" width="400" height="287" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0641_PerlFileHan1.png" alt="Reading file in Perl" border="0">		
Consider we have a perl file with name file.txt and has few lines of text in it. We need to open this file and print the same.
or		
This will print the file content on the output screen.

Now, we will write a program to create and write data to a perl file.		
<img decoding="async" width="400" height="287" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0641_PerlFileHan2.png" alt="Writing file in Perl" border="0">		
This will write the input provided during run-time and creates a file test.txt which will have input.
The above way will always try to create a file named test.txt and writes the input into the file; we will write the same to append the file.

Read, write, appends and create
Now that we have to see how to read, write and append files using basic examples.
We will see few more examples and other functions which help in understanding more about files.		
This method will return the current position of FILEHANDLER in bytes if specified else it will consider the last line as the position.		
Seek function is similar to the fseek system call. This method is used to position the file pointer to a specific location by specifying the bytes followed by either start of the file pointer or end of the file pointer.		
WHENCE is the position of the file pointer to start. Zero will set it from the beginning of the file.
Example:Let input.txt has some data like “Hello this is my world.”		
Output:
this is my world
Unlink is used to delete the file.		
We can also handle directories through which we can handle multiple files.
let’s see how to open a directory. We can use the opendir and readdir methods.		
or		
This will print all the available files in that directory.		
-r
To check if File/directory is readable by the current user/group  
-w
To check if File/directory is writable by the current user/group 
-x
To check if File/directory is executable by the current user/group 
-o
To check if File/directory is owned by the current user 
-R
To check if File/directory is readable by this real user/group 
-W
To check if File/directory is writable by this real user/group 
-X
To check if File/directory is executable by this real user/group 
-O
To check if File/directory is owned by this real user 
-e
To check if File/directory name exists 
-z
To check if File exists and has zero size (always false for directories) 
-f
To check if Entry is a plain file 
-d
To check if Entry is a directory 
-l
To check if Entry is a symbolic link 
-S
To check if Entry is a socket 
-p
To check if Entry is a named pipe (a “FIFO”) 
-b
To check if Entry is a block special file (like a mountable disk) 
-c
To check if Entry is a character special file (like an I/O device) 
-u
To check if File or directory is setuid 
-g
To check if File or directory is setgid 
-k
To check if File or directory has the sticky bit set 
-t
The given filehandle is a TTY (as by the isatty() system function, filenames can’t be tested by this test) 
-T
To check if File looks like a “text” file 
-B
To check if File looks like a “binary” file 
-M
To check Modification age (measured in days) of file
-A
To check Access age (measured in days) of file
-C
To check Inode-modification age (measured in days) of file
Subroutines are similar to functions in other programming languages. We have already used some built-in functions like print, chomp, chop, etc. We can write our own subroutines in Perl. These subroutines can be written anywhere in the program; it is preferable to place the subroutines either at the beginning or at the end of the code. 
<img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0647_PerlSubrout1.png" alt="Subroutine in PERL" border="0">		
Now that, we know how to write a subroutine, how do we access it?
We need to access or call a subroutine using the subroutine name prefixed with ‘&’ symbol.
Subroutines or perl function are written to place the reusable code in it. Most of the reusable code requires parameters to be passed to the subroutine. Here, we will learn how we can pass arguments to the subroutine.
Output:
3 is the value passed
@_ is a special array variable which stores the arguments passed to the subroutines.
We can also use ‘shift’ keyword which shifts one parameter at a time to a variable or $_[0],$_[1]… which is an individual element of @_ array
Output:
hello is passed
Subroutines are typically used in object-oriented programming and also in places where you may have more reusable code to be placed.
Main functionality of subroutines is to do some task and return the result of the reusable code.
<img decoding="async" width="824" height="611" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/030217_0620_PerlTutoria39.png" alt="PERL Tutorial for Beginners - Complete Guide">		
We can return a value from subroutine using the return keyword.
Output:
11
$result will be holding the value of the $a and $b added.
We can also pass hashes and array directly to the subroutine.
Output:
1a2b
We can also return a hash or an array.
Output:
Inside Sub-routine2b1aAfter Sub-routine call2b1a
Perl has a mechanism using which we can generate reports. Using this feature, we can make reports exactly the way we want while printing on the Output screen or in a file. A simple format can be written using printf or sprintf functions available in Perl.
This will include leading zeros in front of number 30 making a total count of digits to 5. The same can be used for sprintf.
Using printf and sprintf, we can obtain most of the Perl formats. In the case of reports, it will be difficult to implement.
<img decoding="async" width="400" height="221" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0651_PerlFormats1.jpg" alt="Perl Format" border="0">




	===========================================================================
	Name            Address            Age            Phone
	===========================================================================
	Krishna            Chennai        24            929309242
	Shruthi            Chennai        24            929309232
	The above is a example reports that we need to print in the same manner in Perl. This can be achieved by using the perl printf and perl sprintf. It can effectively be implemented using format.
	A format can be declared in the below manner.

Here, we will be using a particular method write to print the data onto output screen or into the file.
@
Used to represent the start of the field holder
>
Right alignment of text
<
Left alignment of text
|
Center alignment
#
Numeric if multiple # provided. Assumes as a comment if single # provided
.
Decimal point
^
Start of field holder can also be used for multiline and also for the word-wrap
~
Line should be empty if the variable is empty
@*
Multiple lines.
Execute the code to see the output.
We are using @ symbol to specify the start of the field holder or string, ‘<‘ each character. 
We are using STDOUT to print on the standard output. We can change this to file handler which we are using to write data into the file.
We can replace ‘<‘ to ‘>’ or ‘|’ to change the alignment of the text.STDOUT_TOP is used to design the header of the format.We can also use the same with file handler using FH_TOP( FH is the file handler).This will output the format to the file which we are working on.
Each programmer will have his own sense of writing the code using certain standards; these standards should be familiar enough that other programmer can understand and support the code properly.



Coding Standards in Perl


Writing code is simple and easy. The problem arises when it needs to be maintained at later stages. Proper guidelines and coding standards need to be followed while writing the code. Perl also defines certain standards that will be useful for programmers to write code. It is advisable to load ‘strict’ and ‘warnings module’ while writing the code. Each of these modules has its own importance. Strict will make us declare the variable before using and also will tell if any bare word present in your code. Warnings module can alternatively be used by passing ‘-w’ option to the Perl interpreter in shebang. Warnings will print on the output screen.
Below are few lists of standards.
Ex: open(FH, <file.txt”) or die(“cannot open the file $!”);				
Perfect example with coding standards:
An exception is an event that occurs during the program execution which will suspend or terminate your program.
Error Handling is one which every programmer has to take care during programming. Perl also provides error handling techniques with which we can trap the error and handle those accordingly.



Error Handling in Perl


There are many ways to check for error in the program. We need to examine the return codes of the function that we are using code. If we are able to handle those return codes properly, then most of the error handling can be achieved.
What will return in case of system calls?
In the case of system calls, the return status will get stored in two special variables $? And $!
$! – This will catch the error number or error number associated with the error message.
$? – This will hold the return status system() function.
We can use logical or operator for error handling while using system calls.
Ex:
This will open the file in read mode if the file exists.
What if the file is missing?
Eval function can handle fatal errors, compile time errors, runtime errors and those errors which terminates your code at some point in time.
Perl Eval function can have a block of code or an expression. Evals considers everything placed in it as a string.
Consider a situation of calling a subroutine which is not defined in the script. In this situation, the script terminates stating “undefined subroutine &XYZ, this error can be handled in the eval function.
There are many uses of evals block; one such use is when we want to load the module which is specific to the operating system during runtime.
Ex: Divide by zero causes a fatal error; to handle this we can place the code in evals block.
Output:
syntax error at C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl line 8, near “)
{“
Execution of C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
Example: eval using perl die statement.
Output:
Caught : Dieing in sub test
Perl does not support try, catch and finally code blocks as other programming languages. We can still use them by loading an external Perl module.
use Try::Tiny;
Using this we can place your code in try block and catch the error in warn block.
In place of $@ used in eval Try::Tiny uses $_.
# handle errors with a catch handler
Output:
foo at C:\Users\XYZ\Text.pl line 4.
We can use try, catch and finally in this manner.
try { # statement }
catch {# statement }
finally { # statement };
Or		
Output:
Or

The socket is a medium through which two computers can interact on a network by using network address and ports.
Suppose, A (Server) and B (Client) are two systems, which has to interact with each other using Sockets for running some programs.
To implements this we need to create sockets in both A (Server) and B (Client), A will be in the receiving state and B will be in the sending state.
Here, the server wishes to receive a connection from B (Client) and execute some tasks and send the result back to B (Client). When we execute the code, the operating system in A tries to create a socket and binds one port to that socket. Then it will listen from the sender which is B.
Here, the client wishes to send some program from his system to A (Server) for some processing. When we execute the code, the operating system in B tries to create a socket for communicating with A (Server), B has to specify the IP address and the port number of A to which B wishes to connect.
If this goes well, both systems will interact to exchange the information through one port. Perl also supports socket programming.
Perl has a native API through which sockets can be implemented. To make it easy, there are many CPAN modules using which we write socket programs.
<img decoding="async" width="610" height="266" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2013/07/072013_0659_PerlSocketP2.png" alt="Client-Server Operations in Perl" border="0">		
This is one module for socket programming, which is based on object oriented programming. This module does not support the INET network type used in networks.
This module supports INET domain and is built upon IO::Sockets. All the methods available in IO::Sockets are inherited in INET module.
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol; we will be using this protocol for socket programming.
Before proceeding further let’s see how can we create an object for IO::Socket::INET module and create a socket.
The new method in IO::Socket::INET module accepts a hash as an input parameter to the subroutine. This hash is predefined, and we just need to provide the values to the keys which we want to use. There is a list of keys used by this hash.
PeerAddr
Remote host address
PeerHost
Synonym for PeerAddr
PeerPort
Remote port or service
LocalAddr
Local host bind address
LocalHost
Synonym for LocalAddr
LocalPort
Local host bind port
Proto
Protocol name (or number)
Type
Socket type
Listen
Queue size for listen
ReuseAddr
Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
Reuse
Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
ReusePort
Set SO_REUSEPORT before binding
Broadcast
Set SO_BROADCAST before binding
Timeout
Timeout value for various operations
MultiHomed
Try all addresses for multihomed hosts
Blocking
Determine if connection will be blocking mode
Note:
In socket programming, we will have to execute Server.pl first and then client.pl individually in different command prompts if we are running on local host.
Modules and Packages are closely related to each other and are independent. Package: A Perl package is also known as namespace and which have all unique variables used like hashes, arrays, scalars, and subroutines. Module: Module is a collection of reusable code, where we write subroutines in it. These modules can be loaded in Perl programs to make use of the subroutines written in those modules.
Standard modules will get installed during installation of Perl on any system. CPAN: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network – A global repository of Perl modules. Our own customized Perl Modules which can be written by us. Basically, A module when loaded in any script will export all its global variables and subroutines. These subroutines can directly call as if they were declared in the script itself. Perl Modules can be written with .pm extension to the filename Ex : Foo.pm. A module can be written by using ‘package Foo’ at the beginning of the program.
No Output
To use this Perl module, we have to place it in currently working directory.
We can load a Perl module using require or use anywhere in the code. The major difference between require and use is, require loaded module during runtime and use loads during compile time.
Here, in the above example, we are accessing the subroutines using fully qualified module name.
We can also access the package using ‘use Arithmetic’.
This module has a default functionality of importing methods.
@EXPORT array can be used to pass a list of variables and subroutines which by default will be exported to the caller of the Module.
@EXPORT_OK array can be used to pass a list of variables and subroutines which will be exported on demand basis, where the user has to specify while loading the module.
By default, add subroutine will be exported. Subtract method won’t be exported if it not specified while loading the module.
In this section, we will learn how to create Perl Object oriented Modules. First, let’s see what is the object? An object is an instance using which we can access, modify and locate some data in any Perl module. This is nothing but making your existing Perl package, variables and subroutines to act like class, objects, and methods in reference to other Programming Languages.
We already know how to create modules from the previous topic. The purpose of the class is to store methods and variables. A Perl Module will have subroutines which are methods. We need to access those variables and subroutines objects.
A constructor in Perl is a method which will execute and return us a reference with the module name tagged to the reference. This is called as blessing the class. We use a particular variable for blessing a perl class, which is bless.
The new method used as a constructor for a class, This constructor will create an object for us and will return to the script which is calling this constructor.
Here, we need to understand how the object created. Whenever we try to create an object for the class, we need to use the full name of the class. Suppose, if the perl class is located in some lib\Math\Arithmetic.pm. And, if we want to access this perl class from the lib directory then we have to provide the entire path of to the class while calling in the script.
This is how the object creation in Perl happens.
How does Perl script know where library module exists? Perl only knows about current directory of the script and the Perl inbuilt library path. Whenever we use, and Perl module, which is not located in the current directory or Perl library Path, the script will always fail. About @INC, this is an array, which holds all directory paths where it has to look for the Perl modules. Try to execute this command and see what will be the output.
This will give some output, and that is the path where the lib Modules will be available. Whenever we use any new library module, we need to tell Perl, interpreter, to look into that particular location where Perl module is available.
Make this as your first line of code. This will tell your interpreter to look into that Path. or use		
The destructor of an object is by default called at the end and before your script exits. This is used to destroy your objects from memory.

Perl is widely used in automation. It may not be the best programming languages in the world but its best suited for certain types of tasks. Let’s discuss where & why Perl is used for Automation Testing.
<img decoding="async" title="How PERL is used in Automation Testing" alt="Storage Testing using Perl" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/PERLinAutomationTesting1.png" style="float: left;">

					What is Storage? Data stored in Files.

					Suppose, we have a Storage related Test Case where we have to write data on one partition, read it & verify that the data is written correctly.

					This can be done manually, but can a manual tester perform the same 10000 times? It will be a nightmare! We need automation

	Best tool to automate anything related to storage is Perl because of its File Handling Techniques, REGEX and powerful file parsing which consumes least execution time compared to other programming languages.

	Why we need to test storage? Think about large Data Centers where data will be flowing continuously from one system to other system with 1000’s of records being stored per second. Testing robustness of such storage mechanism is essential.

	Many companies like HP, Dell, IBM and many server manufacture use Perl as an interface to test functionality in Storage and Networking domains. NetApp is one such company which completely works on Storage and uses Perl as the Programming language to automate the test cases.

	If you are interested in Perl Automation, then it would be advisable to learn about Storage & Networking Concepts.



Server and Network Testing using Perl



	PERL is widely used in server uptime and performance monitoring.

	Consider a data center which has 100 hosts(servers). You are required to connect to each host, execute some commands remotely. You also want to reboot the system and check when it comes back online.

	Manually doing this task for all 100 hosts will be a nightmare. But we can easily automate this using PERL

	Design steps to achieve this above automation using PERL

	We will code the above scenario.

	Let’s take a file called Input.txt which will store the complete info about all the hosts in which we need to connect and execute the command.

	Input.txt

	192.168.1.2 root password

	192.168.1.3 root password

	192.168.1.4 root root123
HostCheck.pl

	Web Testing

  Perl is not only restricted to Storage & Network testing. We can also perform Web-based testing using PERL. WWW-Mechanize is one module used for web testing. Basically, it won’t launch any browser to test the functionality of web application’s rather it uses the source code of the html pages.
We can also perform browser based testing using Selenium IDE, RC, Web driver. Perl is supported for Selenium.

JavaScript is an open-source and most popular client-side scripting language supported by all browsers. JavaScript is mainly used for enhancing the interaction of the webpage with users by making it more lively and interactive. It is also used for game development and mobile application development.
In this JavaScript basics for beginners tutorial, you will learn about some fundamentals of JavaScript like Variables, Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements, Cookies, etc., and some advanced JavaScript concepts like DOM, practical code examples, JavaScript Unit testing frameworks, algorithms, etc.
Nothing! This is an absolute JavaScript beginner guide to learn JavaScript with examples. However, if you have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, it will help you learn faster and more efficiently.
This JavaScript for beginners tutorial is for students who want to learn about Web application development and software development. This tutorial is also helpful for the professionals working in web application development to enhance their knowledge and skills.
JavaScript is the most popular client-side programming language which is widely used for web application development in every industry. There is a huge demand in the IT industry for candidates having knowledge of JavaScript. Therefore, learning JavaScript is beneficial for you to get a good job and also enhance your skills and knowledge as well.
JavaScript Engines are complicated. But it works on some simple basics:
Here, JavaScript engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It reads a compiled script and analyzes the data that passes in JavaScript engine. After that, it applies optimizations to the machine code from that acquired knowledge. When this process is completed, scripts run quite fast.
JavaScript’s functionality depends on the environment it’s running in. For example, Node.js supports functions which allows JavaScript to read and write  arbitrary files, perform network requests, object-oriented, etc. The roles that JavaScript plays in both client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) development of applications can vary wildly.
In-browser JavaScript also allows you to perform webpage manipulation, interaction with the user and with the web server.
JavaScript’s capabilities in the browser are quite limited for the sake of the user’s safety. It helps to prevent any unauthorized webpage from accessing private information.
Examples of such limitations are: 
Here, are the three most important features which make JavaScript unique

The syntax of JavaScript not suited for everyone as different project demands different features. However, some modern tools like a Coffee script, Typescript, and Dart allowing developers to code in another language and then auto-convert into the JavaScript code.
ECMAScript is a specification governed by ECMA international aimed at standardizing JavaScript. The latest version is ECMA9 also called JavaScript 9. It is supported by all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. Though each browser has an array of unique commands that are not part of the standards.

Before we learn Embedded System, lets learn:
A system is an arrangement where all its component work according to the specific defined rules. It is a method of organizing, working, or performing one or more tasks according to a fixed plan.
Embedded System is a combination of computer software and hardware which is either fixed in capability or programmable. An embedded system can be either an independent system, or it can be a part of a large system. It is mostly designed for a specific function or functions within a larger system. For example, a fire alarm is a common example of an embedded system which can sense only smoke.
Laser Printers are one of the examples of Embedded Systems which uses embedded systems to manage various aspect of the printing. Apart from performing the main task of printing, it has to take user inputs, manage communication with the computer system, to handle faults, and sense papers left on the tray, etc.
Here, the main task of the microprocessor is to understand the text and control the printing head in such a way that it discharges ink where it is needed.
To perform this, it needs to decode the different files given to it and understand the font and graphics. It will consume substantial CPU time to process the data as well as it has to take user inputs, control motors, etc.
Here, are important milestones from the history of embedded system:
Following are important characteristics of an embedded system:
Now in this Embedded Systems tutorial, we will cover some important terms used in embedded system.
This measure of the survival probability of the system when the function is critical during the run time.
Fault-Tolerance is the capability of a computer system to survive in the presence of faults.
Embedded system must meet various timing and other constraints. They are imposed on it by the real-time natural behavior of the external world.
For example, an airforce department which keeps track of incoming missile attacks must precisely calculate and plan their counter-attack due to hard real-time deadline. Otherwise, it’ll get destroyed.
It’s building systems with built-in debugging opportunities which allows remote maintenance.  
For example, you are building a spacecraft which will land on another planter to collect various types of data and send collected detail back to us. If this spacecraft went insane and lost the control, we should be able to make some important diagnostic. So, flexibility is vital while designing an embedded system.
Portability is a measure of the ease of using the same embedded software in various environments. It requires generalized abstractions between the application program logic itself and the low-level system interfaces.
A microcontroller is a single-chip VLSI unit which is also called microcomputer. It contains all the memory and I/O interfaces needed, whereas a general-purpose microprocessor needs additional chips to offered by these necessary functions. Microcontrollers are widely used in embedded systems for real-time control applications.
A microprocessor is a single chip semiconductor device. Its CPU contains a program counter, an ALU a stack pointer, working register, a clock timing circuit. It also includes ROM and RAM, memory decoder, and many serial and parallel ports.
Below is basic architecture of the Embedded System:
Sensor helps you to measures the physical quantity and converts it to an electrical signal. It also stores the measured quantity to the memory. This signal can be ready by an observer or by any electronic instrument such as A2D converter.
A-D converter (analog-to-digital converter) allows you to convert an analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.
Memory is used to store information. Embedded System majorly contains two memory cells 1) Volatile 2) Non volatile memory.
This component processes the data to measure the output and store it to the memory.
D-A converter (A digital-to-analog converter) helps you to convert the digital data fed by the processor to analog data.
An actuator allows you to compare the output given by the D-A converter to the actual output stored in it and stores the approved output in the memory.
Three types of Embedded Systems are:

This embedded system can be designed with a single 8 or 16-bit microcontroller. It can be operated with the help of a battery. For developing small scale embedded system, an editor, assembler, (IDE), and cross assembler are the most vital programming tools.
These types of embedded systems are designed using 16 or 32-bit microcontrollers. These systems offer both hardware and software complexities. C, C++, Java, and source code engineering tool, etc. are used to develop this kind of embedded system.
This type of embedded systems have lots of hardware and software complexities. You may require IPS, ASIPS, PLAs, configuration processor, or scalable processors. For the development of this system, you need hardware and software co-design & components which needs to combine in the final system.
Learn the difference between Microprocessor and Microcontroller
Following are the important applications of Embedded system:
Robotic science
Medical
Automotive
Networking
Home Devices
Automobiles
Industrial Control
Here, are Pros/benefits of using Embedded System:
Here, are important cons/ drawbacks of using Embedded system.

Go (also known as Golang) is an open source programming language developed by Google. It is a statically-typed compiled language. Go supports concurrent programming, i.e. it allows running multiple processes simultaneously. This is achieved using channels, goroutines, etc. Go Language has garbage collection which itself does the memory management and allows the deferred execution of functions.
We will learn all the basics of Golang in this Learn Go Language Tutorial.
Step 1) Go to https://golang.org/dl/. Download the binary for your OS.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="700" height="215" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi1.png" alt="">

<img decoding="async" width="509" height="391" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi3.png" alt="">		
Step 4) Select the installation folder and click Next.
<img decoding="async" width="479" height="398" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi4.png" alt="">		
Step 5) Click Finish once the installation is complete.
<img decoding="async" width="502" height="385" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi5.png" alt="">		
Step 6)  Once the installation is complete you can verify it by opening the terminal and typing
This will display the version of go installed
<img decoding="async" width="355" height="97" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi6.png" alt="">		
Create a folder called studyGo. In this Go language tutorial, we will create our go programs inside this folder. Go files are created with the extension .go. You can run Go programs using the syntax
Create a file called first.go and add the below code into it and save
<img decoding="async" width="602" height="411" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi7.png" alt="">		
Navigate to this folder in your terminal. Run the program using the command
    go run first.go
You can see the output printing
<img decoding="async" width="655" height="185" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi8.png" alt="">			
Now let’s discuss the above program.
package main – Every Go Language program should start with a package name. Go allows us to use packages in another go programs and hence supports code reusability. Execution of a Go program begins with the code inside the package named main.			
import fmt – imports the package fmt. This package implements the I/O functions.
func main() – This is the function from which program execution begins. The main function should always be placed in the main package. Under the main(), You can write the code inside { }.
fmt.Println – This will print the text on the screen by the Println function of fmt.
Note: In the below sections of this Go tutorial, when You mention execute/run the code, it means to save the code in a file with .go extension and run it using the syntax
Types(data types) represent the type of the value stored in a variable, type of the value a function returns, etc.
There are three basic types in Go Language
Numeric types – Represent numeric values which includes integer, floating point, and complex values. Various numeric types are:
int8 – 8 bit signed integers.
int16 – 16 bit signed integers.
int32 – 32 bit signed integers.
int64 – 64 bit signed integers.
uint8 – 8 bit unsigned integers.
uint16 – 16 bit unsigned integers.
uint32 – 32 bit unsigned integers.
uint64 – 64 bit unsigned integers.
float32 – 32 bit floating point numbers.
float64 – 64 bit floating point numbers.
complex64 – has float32 real and imaginary parts.
complex128 – has float32 real and imaginary parts.
String types – Represents a sequence of bytes(characters). You can do various operations on strings like string concatenation, extracting substring, etc
Boolean types –  Represents 2 values, either true or false.
Golang Interface is a collection of method signatures used by a Type to implement the behavior of objects. The main goal of Golang interface is to provide method signatures with names, arguments, and return types. It is up to a Type to declare and implement the method. An interface in Golang can be declared using the keyword “interface.”
Variables point to a memory location which stores some kind of value. The type parameter(in the below syntax) represents the type of value that can be stored in the memory location.
Variable can be declared using the syntax
Once You declare a variable of a type You can assign the variable to any value of that type.
You can also give an initial value to a variable during the declaration itself using 
If You declare the variable with an initial value, Go an infer the type of the variable from the type of value assigned. So You can omit the type during the declaration using the syntax
Also, You can declare multiple variables with the syntax
The below program in this Go tutorial has some Golang examples of variable declarations 
The output will be
Go Language also provides an easy way of declaring the variables with value by omitting the var keyword using
Note that You used := instead of =.  You cannot use := just to assign a value to a variable which is already declared. := is used to declare and assign value.
Create a file called assign.go with the following code 
Execute go run assign.go to see the result as
Variables declared without an initial value will have of 0 for numeric types, false for Boolean and empty string for strings
Constant variables are those variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned. A constant in Go programming language is declared by using the keyword “const”
Create a file called constant.go and with the following code
Execute go run constant.go to see the result as
Loops are used to execute a block of statements repeatedly based on a condition. Most of the programming languages provide 3 types of loops – for, while, do while. But Go programming language supports only for loop.		
The syntax of a Golang for loop is 
The initialisation_expression is executed first(and only once) in Golang for loop. 
Then the evaluation_expression is evaluated and if it’s true the code inside the block is executed.
The iteration_expression id is executed, and the evaluation_expression is evaluated again. If it’s true the statement block gets executed again. This will continue until the evaluation_expression becomes false.
Copy the below program into a file and execute it to see the Golang for loop printing numbers from 1 to 5
Output is 
If else is a conditional statement. The synax is 
Here the condition is evaluated and if it’s true statements_1 will be executed else statements_2 will be executed.
You can use if statement without else also. You also can have chained if else statements. The below programs will explain more about if else.
Execute the below program. It checks if a number, x, is less than 10. If so, it will print “x is less than 10”
Here since the value of x is greater than 10, the statement inside if block condition will not executed.
Now see the below program. In this Go programming language tutorial, we have an else block which will get executed on the failure of if evaluation.
This program will give you output
Now in this Go tutorial, we will see a program with multiple if else blocks(chained if else). Execute the below Go example. It checks whether a number is less than 10 or is between 10-90 or greater than 90.
Here first the if condition checks whether x is less than 10 and it’s not. So it checks the next condition(else if) whether it’s between 10 and 90 which is also false. So it then executes the block under the else section which gives the output
Switch is another conditional statement. Switch statements evaluate an expression and the result is compared against a set of available values(cases). Once a match is found the statements associated with that match(case) is executed. If no match is found nothing will be executed. You can also add a default case to switch which will be executed if no other matches are found. The syntax of the switch is 
Here the value of the expression is compared against the values in each case. Once a match is found the statements associated with that case is executed. If no match is found the statements under the default section is executed. 
Execute the below program 
You will get the output as 
Change the value of a and b to 3 and the result will be 
You can also have multiple values in a case by separating them with a comma.
Array represents a fixed size, named sequence of elements of the same type. You cannot have an array which contains both integer and characters in it. You cannot change the size of an array once You define the size.
The syntax for declaring an array is
Each array element can be assigned value using the syntax
Array index starts from 0 to size-1.
You can assign values to array elements during declaration using the syntax
You can also ignore the size parameter while declaring the array with values by replacing size with … and the compiler will find the length from the number of values. Syntax is
You can find the length of the array by using the syntax
Execute the below Go example to understand the array 
Output
A slice is a portion or segment of an array. Or it is a view or partial view of an underlying array to which it points. You can access the elements of a slice using the slice name and index number just as you do in an array. You cannot change the length of an array, but you can change the size of a slice.
Contents of a slice are actually the pointers to the elements of an array. It means if you change any element in a slice, the underlying array contents also will be affected.
The syntax for creating a slice is 
This will create a slice named slice_name from an array named array_name with the elements at the index start to end-1.
Now in this Golang tutorial, we will execute the below program. The program will create a slice from the array and print it. Also, you can see that modifying the contents in the slice will modify the actual array.
This will print result as
There are certain functions like Golang len, Golang append which you can apply on slices
len(slice_name) – returns the length of the slice
append(slice_name, value_1, value_2) – Golang append is used to append value_1 and value_2 to an existing slice.
append(slice_nale1,slice_name2…) – appends slice_name2 to slice_name1
Execute the following program.
The output will be
The program first creates 2 slices and printed its length. Then it appended one slice to other and then appended a string to the resulting slice.
A function represents a block of statements which performs a specific task. A function declaration tells us function name, return type and input parameters. Function definition represents the code contained in the function. The syntax for declaring the function is 
The parameters and return types are optional. Also, you can return multiple values from a function.
Now in this Golang tutorial, let’s run the following Golang example. Here function named calc will accept 2 numbers and performs the addition and subtraction and returns both values.
The output will be
Packages are used to organize the code. In a big project, it is not feasible to write code in a single file. Go programming language allow us to organize the code under different packages. This increases code readability and reusability. An executable Go program should contain a package named main and the program execution starts from the function named main. You can import other packages in our program using the syntax
We will see and discuss in this Golang tutorial, how to create and use packages in the following Golang example.
Step 1) Create a file called package_example.go and add the below code
In the above program fmt is a package which Go programming language provides us mainly for I/O purposes. Also, you can see a package named calculation. Inside the main() you can see a step sum := calculation.Do_add(x,y). It means you are invoking the function Do_add from package calculation.
Step 2)			First, you should create the package calculation inside a folder with the same name under src folder of the go. The installed path of go can be found from the PATH variable. 
For mac, find the path by executing echo $PATH		
<img decoding="async" width="820" height="62" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi9.png" alt="">		
So the path is /usr/local/go
For windows, find the path by executing echo %GOROOT%			
<img decoding="async" width="850" height="103" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi11.png" alt="">		
Here the path is C:\Go\
Step 3)  Navigate to to the src folder(/usr/local/go/src for mac  and C:\Go\src for windows). Now from the code, the package name is calculation. Go requires the package should be placed in a directory of the same name under src directory. Create a directory named calculation in src folder.
Step 4) Create a file called calc.go (You can give any name, but the package name in the code matters. Here it should be calculation) inside calculation directory and add the below code
Step 5) Run the command go install from the calculation directory which will compile the calc.go.
<img decoding="async" width="932" height="276" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/020819_0833_GoProgrammi12.png" alt="">		
Step 6) Now go back to package_example.go and run go run package_example.go. The output will be Sum 25.		
Note that the name of the function Do_add starts with a capital letter. This is because in Go if the function name starts with a capital letter it means other programs can see(access) it else other programs cannot access it. If the function name was do_add , then You would have got the error
cannot refer to unexported name calculation.calc..
Defer statements are used to defer the execution of a function call until the function that contains the defer statement completes execution.
Lets learn this with an example: 
The output will be
Here execution of sample() is deferred until the execution of the enclosing function(main()) completes.
Stacking defer is using multiple defer statements. Suppose you have multiple defer statements inside a function. Go places all the deferred function calls in a stack, and once the enclosing function returns, the stacked functions are executed in the Last In First Out(LIFO) order. You can see this in the below example. 
Execute the below code
The output will be
Here the code inside the main() executes first, and then the deferred function calls are executed in the reverse order, i.e. 4, 3,2,1.
Before explaining pointers let’s will first discuss ‘&’ operator. The ‘&’ operator is used to get the address of a variable. It means ‘&a’ will print the memory address of variable a.
In this Golang tutorial, we will execute the below program to display the value of a variable and the address of that variable
The result will be
A pointer variable stores the memory address of another variable. You can define a pointer using the syntax
The asterisk(*) represents the variable is a pointer. You will understand more by executing the below program
The output will be
A Structure is a user defined datatype which itself contains one more element of the same or different type. 
Using a structure is a 2 step process. 
First, create(declare) a structure type 
Second, create variables of that type to store values.
Structures are mainly used when you want to store related data together. 
Consider a piece of employee information which has name, age, and address. You can handle this in 2 ways
Create 3 arrays – one array stores the names of employees, one stores age and the third one stores age. 
Declare a structure type with 3 fields- name, address, and age. Create an array of that structure type where each element is a structure object having name, address, and age.
The first approach is not efficient. In these kinds of scenarios, structures are more convenient.
The syntax for declaring a structure is
An example of a structure declaration is 
Here a new user defined type named emp is created. Now, you can create variables of the type emp using the syntax
An example is
You can set values for the empdata1 as
You can also create a structure variable and assign values by
Here, you need to maintain the order of elements. Raj will be mapped to name, next element to address and the last one to age.
Execute the code below
Output
A method is a function with a receiver argument. Architecturally, it’s between the func keyword and method name. The syntax of a method is 
Let’s convert the above example program to use methods instead of function.
Go is not an object oriented language and it doesn’t have the concept of class. Methods give a feel of what you do in object oriented programs where the functions of a class are invoked using the syntax objectname.functionname()
Go supports concurrent execution of tasks. It means Go can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. It is different from the concept of parallelism. In parallelism, a task is split into small subtasks and are executed in parallel. But in concurrency, multiple tasks are being executed simultaneously. Concurrency is achieved in Go using Goroutines and Channels.
A goroutine is a function which can run concurrently with other functions. Usually when a function is invoked the control gets transferred into the called function, and once its completed execution control returns to the calling function. The calling function then continues its execution. The calling function waits for the invoked function to complete the execution before it proceeds with the rest of the statements.
But in the case of goroutine, the calling function will not wait for the execution of the invoked function to complete. It will continue to execute with the next statements. You can have multiple goroutines in a program.
Also, the main program will exit once it completes executing its statements and it will not wait for completion of the goroutines invoked. 
Goroutine is invoked using keyword go followed by a function call.
Example
You will understand goroutines with the below Golang examples. Execute the below program
The output will be
Here the main program completed execution even before the goroutine started. The display() is a goroutine which is invoked using the syntax
In the above code, the main() doesn’t wait for the display() to complete, and the main() completed its execution before the display() executed its code. So the print statement inside display() didn’t get printed.
Now we modify the program to print the statements from display() as well. We add a time delay of 2 sec in the for loop of main() and a 1 sec delay in the for loop of the display().
The output will be somewhat similar to 
Here You can see both loops are being executed in an overlapping fashion because of the concurrent execution.
Channels are a way for functions to communicate with each other. It can be thought as a medium to where one routine places data and is accessed by another routine in Golang server.
A channel can be declared with the syntax
Example:
You can send data to a channel using the syntax
Example
You can receive data from a channel using the syntax
Example
In the above Go language examples of goroutine, you have seen the main program doesn’t wait for the goroutine. But that is not the case when channels are involved. Suppose if a goroutine pushes data to channel, the main() will wait on the statement receiving channel data until it gets the data. 
You will see this in below Go language examples. First, write a normal goroutine and see the behaviour. Then modify the program to use channels and see the behaviour.
Execute the below program
The output will be 
The main() finished the execution and did exit before the goroutine executes. So the print inside the display() didn’t get executed. 
Now modify the above program to use channels and see the behaviour.
The output will be
Here what happens is the main() on reaching x := <-ch will wait for data on channel ch. The display() has a wait of 5 seconds and then push data to the channel ch. The main() on receiving the data from the channel gets unblocked and continues its execution.
The sender who pushes data to channel can inform the receivers that no more data will be added to the channel by closing the channel. This is mainly used when you use a loop to push data to a channel. A channel can be closed using
And at the receiver end, it is possible to check whether the channel is closed using an additional variable while fetching data from channel using
If the status is True it means you received data from the channel. If false, it means you are trying to read from a closed channel
You can also use channels for communication between goroutines. Need to use 2 goroutines – one pushes data to the channel and other receives the data from the channel. See the below program
Here there are 2 subroutines one pushes data to the channel and other prints data to the channel. The function add_to_channel adds the numbers from 0 to 9 and closes the channel. Simultaneously the function fetch_from_channel waits at
x, flag := <- ch and once the data become available, it prints the data. It exits once the flag is false which means the channel is closed.
The wait in the main() is given to prevent the exiting of main() until the goroutines finish the execution.
Execute the code and see the output as
Select can be viewed as a switch statement which works on channels. Here the case statements will be a channel operation.  Usually, each case statements will be read attempt from the channel. When any of the cases is ready(the channel is read), then the statement associated with that case is executed. If multiple cases are ready, it will choose a random one. You can have a default case which is executed if none of the cases is ready.
Let’s see the below code
Executing the above program will give the output:
Here the select statement waits for data to be available in any of the channels. The data2() adds data to the channel after a sleep of 2 seconds which will cause the second case to execute.
Add a default case to the select in the same program and see the output. Here, on reaching select block, if no case is having data ready on the channel, it will execute the default block without waiting for data to be available on any channel.
This program will give the output:
This is because when the select block reached, no channel had data for reading. So, the default case is executed.
Mutex is the short form for mutual exclusion. Mutex is used when you don’t want to allow a resource to be accessed by multiple subroutines at the same time. Mutex has 2 methods – Lock and Unlock. Mutex is contained in sync package. So, you have to import the sync package. The statements which have to be mutually exclusively executed can be placed inside mutex.Lock() and mutex.Unlock().
Let’s learn mutex with an example which is counting the number of times a loop is executed. In this program we expect routine to run loop 10 times and the count is stored in sum. You call this routine 3 times so the total count should be 30. The count is stored in a global variable count.
First, You run the program without mutex
See the result
The result could be different when you execute it but the final result won’t be 30.
Here what happens is 3 goroutines are trying to increase the loop count stored in the variable count. Suppose at a moment count is 5 and goroutine1 is going to increment the count to 6. The main steps include
Copy count to temp
Increment temp
Store temp back to count
Suppose soon after performing step 3 by goroutine1; another goroutine might have an old value say 3 does the above steps and store 4 back, which is wrong. This can be prevented by using mutex which causes other routines to wait when one routine is already using the variable.
Now You will run the program with mutex. Here the above mentioned 3 steps are executed in a mutex.
Now the output will be
Here we get the expected result as final output. Because the statements reading, incrementing and writing back of count is executed in a mutex.
Errors are abnormal conditions like closing a file which is not opened, open a file which doesn’t exist, etc. Functions usually return errors as the last return value.
The below example explains more about the error.
The output will be:
Here we tried to open a non-existing file, and it returned the error to er variable. If the file is valid, then the error will be null
Using this feature, you can create  custom errors. This is done by using New() of error package. We will rewrite the above program to make use of custom errors.
Run the below program
The output will be:
Here the area() returns the area of a square. If the input is less than 1 then area() returns an error message.
Files are used to store data. Go allows us to read data from the files
First create a file, data.txt, in your present directory with the below content.
Now run the below program to see it prints the contents of the entire file as output
Here the data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(“data.txt”) reads the data and returns a byte sequence. While printing it is converted to string format. 			
You will see this with a program
Here a file is created, test.txt. If the file already exists then the contents of the file are truncated. Writeline() is used to write the contents to the file. After that, You closed the file using Close().

Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or people called “things” that are embedded with software, electronics, network, and sensors that allows these objects to collect and exchange data. The goal of IoT is to extend to internet connectivity from standard devices like computer, mobile, tablet to relatively dumb devices like a toaster.
IoT makes virtually everything “smart,” by improving aspects of our life with the power of data collection, AI algorithm, and networks. The thing in IoT can also be a person with a diabetes monitor implant, an animal with tracking devices, etc. This IoT tutorial for beginners covers all the Basics of IoT.
The entire IoT process starts with the devices themselves like smartphones, smartwatches, electronic appliances like TV, Washing Machine which helps you to communicate with the IoT platform.
Now in this IoT tutorial, we will learn about four fundamental components of an IoT system:
1) Sensors/Devices:  Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. All this data may have various levels of complexities. It could be a simple temperature monitoring sensor, or it may be in the form of the video feed.
A device may have various types of sensors which performs multiple tasks apart from sensing. Example, A mobile phone is a device which has multiple sensors like GPS, camera but your smartphone is not able to sense these things.
2) Connectivity:  All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communications. These communication mediums include mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc.
3) Data Processing: Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data. This process can be just checking the temperature, reading on devices like AC or heaters. However, it can sometimes also be very complex like identifying objects, using computer vision on video.
4)User Interface:  The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notification through email or text message.  The user sometimes might need an interface which actively checks their IoT system. For example, the user has a camera installed in his home. He wants to access video recording and all the feeds with the help of a web server.
However, it’s not always one-way communication. Depending on the IoT application and complexity of the system, the user may also be able to perform an action which may create cascading effects.
For example, if a user detects any changes in the temperature of the refrigerator, with the help of IoT technology the user should able to adjust the temperature with the help of their mobile phone.

33 Hard Drive Tested
250+ Hours of Research
1.5k+ Reviews Examined
Unbiased Reviews
When people talk about the essentials for the perfect gaming experience, many of them forget to mention one important piece. The hard drive. You might have the best gaming monitor, a special mouse, and keyboard, a gaming pad maybe or even a gaming chair but these will mean nothing when you have no space to install your games.
Which is why you need a dedicated gaming hardware. Not only does it allow you enough space for storing your favorite games but are also optimized to reduce the load time and minimize game lagging. Moreover, with over 100 different types of best gaming hard drives available, you will find our list of the top 7 best gaming hard disks pretty useful.



Sometimes we just want to add extra storage to our devices without having to replace the existing hard drive. If you are using a desktop PC, this may not be a problem since they usually allow space for additional hard drives, but it’s different with a laptop.
Storage Capacity: 1TB to 8TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 256MB
Warranty: 2 Years
Seagate External hard drive is ideal for laptop gamers. These are available in sizes starting from 1TB up to 8TB, and all you have to do is connect them to a power outlet then to your computer using the 3.0 or 2.O USB ports. However, if you are using a Mac, you will need to reformat them in order to be fully compatible.
If you are a game hoarder like me, then you will appreciate the value this expansion hard disk brings. I really find it hard to delete games even when it’s necessary, but with an extra 4TB I can keep my collection of games and check them out whenever I am not in the mood for playing the usual.
Western Digital is one of the leading brands in the manufacture of hard disks and you can, therefore, expect superior products from them. The WD Black series is one such example we highly recommend as an upgrade for your laptop hard disk.
Storage Capacity: 250GB to 8TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 32MB
Warranty: 5 Years
You can choose from its several capacities starting from 250GB to 8TB, but for this review, we will look at the WD Black 2TB. Why? It offers sufficient space for all your game’s downloadable content (DLC), it’s quite affordable, and most importantly, it excels in performance levels. Now, nothing is stopping you from getting the new Fortnite Founder’s pack.
Equipped with a dual-core processor, you can expect excellent load times with read/write speed of almost 200mbps. It also features 64MB of cache which is also crucial in boosting the load and access time. To top it off it comes with the industry’s best rotation speed of 7200RPS.
It also features various protection mechanisms like No Touch Ramp Load technology and Corruption Protection Technology that are meant to safeguard your data better. Physically this hard disk also includes a layer of silica gel on top of the plastic wrapper to ensure better protection against moisture.
Seagate came up with the FireCuda hard disk series to specifically cater for the gamers, and hence all of its features are meant to improve your gaming experience. Which is why it is only available in 1TB and 2TB version since any lesser capacity is not really ideal in this modern gaming era.
Storage Capacity: 1TB & 2TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
The FireCuda 3.5″ SSHD is the bigger desktop version of the Seagate FireCuda 2.5″ SSHD and comes with 7200RPM, 64MB of cache and a SATA 6Gb/s connection. However, the highlight of this Hard disk is its Hybrid architecture.
It is the perfect fusion between an SSD and an HDD. That is it combines the speed of an SSD and the storage capabilities of the HDD. By using adaptive learning, the FireCuda can memorize the frequently accessed games and save them in the flash memory. This significantly reduces the access time to these games.
Comparatively, this hard disk produces high performance than the 2.5” FireCuda, but this can be attributed to its larger size which allows more space for the rotating disks.
Other mentionable features include the Instant Secure Erase to safely and easily delete content from the hard drive. The Self-Encrypting technology protects your data. You also get a 2-year warranty.
Until recently, the biggest storage space you could get on the Xbox is 500GB. Even now you will have to cough up more bucks to get the 1TB SSD. But do you know what’s better than the wd blue 1TB SSD from Microsoft? The Seagate 4TB hard drive specifically made for the Xbox.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 4TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 128MB
Warranty: 2 Years
This self-powered hard disk may be a bit bigger than its 2TB counterpart, but it is still pretty convenient to carry around. It features USB 3.0 ports which means data transfer is quite fast. It only takes a few minutes to copy Halo 5 which is more than 50GB in size.
Another thing we found pretty convenient is the Plug and Play setup which means once the Xbox recognizes the hard disk it only takes some seconds to load the game. You will also find that it takes less time to load your game’s DLC than with the internal hard drive.
Additionally, you can use the drive to save movies and other media files that can be played through your Xbox console. This hard drive comes with a 2-year warranty.
The Samsung 860 Evo follows up on the success of its predecessor, the 850 Evo, and having inherited everything we liked on the 850 EVO it’s easy to understand why we recommend this SSD storage device.
Storage Capacity: 250GB to 4TB
Seq.Read/Write Speed: 550/520MB/s
Cache: 512MB LPDDR4 (250/500GB)
Warranty: 5 Years
However, it is the incredible speed of the SSD that will really appeal to you as a gamer. Although this is typical of all SSDs, Samsung takes it a notch higher with their latest V-NAND technology that can sequentially read at speeds of 550MB/s and write at about 520MB/s. This is more than 2x the standard HDD.
This hard drive has also seen a 51% increase in performance from the 850 EVO with 6x more endurance. Also, unlike some other drives relying on software-based encryption, the Samsung 860 EVO comes with the Self Encrypting Drive technology that ensures that your data is safe without affecting the hard disk performance.
Now, we can all agree that upgrading to a new hard drive can be a hassle especially considering you have to reinstall the OS then move all your old files to the new drive. But now thanks to the Samsung Data Migration software, this process has been really streamlined.
You also have the option to download the Samsung Magician software that will help you monitor and maintain the SSD. This drive comes with a 5-year warranty and is available in sizes ranging from 250GB to 4TB.
I have mentioned that gaming hard drives should be large in size, but that does not automatically rule out the smaller drives. Especially if you have a tight budget or if your game library is not insanely big.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 6 TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
The WD Blue hard drive is one of the best budget hard drives you can buy for gaming. With a rotation speed of 7200RPM and a cache size of 8MB, this drive will still be able to provide a decent load and access time.
Of course, you will have to compromise on the number and size of the games you play, but considering the price I would say you will be getting the best value for your money. On top of getting a 2-year warranty from the reseller, you also have the option to return the product for a full refund.
Don’t you hate it when you have to wait for what seems like forever for your game to load? Well, with a 64 MB cache size and 7200RPM you will definitely notice faster load time. With 2TB of storage space, it’s hard to envision you having any trouble with inadequate space even after installing all the available mods for your games.
Storage Capacity: 500GB to 3TB
Speed: 7200 RPM
Cache: 64MB
Warranty: 2 Years
Toshiba has also included a caching technology that efficiently allocates the cache space during read and write cycles resulting in faster access to your games. They have also taken the necessary measures to protect your data which is evident through the internal shock sensors that absorb any impacts resulting from falls or knocks and the secured motor shaft that protects the hard drive against system vibrations.
The No-Touch Ramp-load tech also helps to reduce the wearing down of the recording head by ensuring that it does not touch the disk surface. This series of Toshiba hard disks are available in sizes ranging from 500GB-3TB and comes with a 2-year standard limited Warranty.
So, we just gave you the best hard drives but how do you really end up concluding that this is the most suited drive for your gaming needs? Follow along as we tell you everything you need to know before purchasing as your pc gaming hard drive. We will begin by answering the one question that no one seems to agree on.
Well, no one can argue that SSD is considerably faster than the HDD. This is because unlike the HDD which stores data by manipulating magnetic fields created by spinning metal plates, the SSD uses flash memory similar to that of a USB flash drive which is much faster to read and write on.
The HDD, on the other hand, is considered to be more long-lasting and is without doubt, cheaper than SSD per Gigabyte. You will be surprised to learn that it might cost you more to purchase a 500GB SSD than it would if you are buying a 4TB HDD.
So, to answer the question, I will say that it depends on what you are really after. Personally, I recommend the HDD since as much as it is slower than the SSD, it’s not extremely slow, and it’s something you can easily compromise especially considering the amount of money you will be saving. You can check out the detailed comparison of SSDs vs. HDDs here
While buying Gaming HDD, you should consider the following factors:  
Here are more details:
To avoid disappointments after buying the hard disk, you need to ask yourself some few questions and also familiarize yourself with some of the important features of the hard drives. This way you have a better understanding of what you are really getting. Which are these factors?
source
The main advantage of the external hard disks is their portability. Which also makes them perfect backups in case your PC is compromised. Desktop PCs allow you room to add extra hard disks, but if you are using a laptop or other gaming device, you will have to replace your existing hard drive.
I am assuming the main reason you are buying the hard disk is so that you eliminate the need to have to delete some files when you want to install a new game or add modifications. Also, at a time when a single game can take up to 100GB, Call of Duty WWII is 90GB; it only makes sense that you select the hard disk that will allow you sufficient storage.
The hard drives store information on spinning magnetic plates. Right? Now, the faster these plates spin then, the faster the load and access time. The rotation is measured in RPM (Rotations per Minute), and although we recommend hard disks with 7200RPM, you can still make do with 5400RPM.
This functions very much like Computer RAM Memory by storing important files temporarily so that it takes less time to access this data on the disk.
Generally, the larger the Cache size, the faster the hard disk will be. However, the difference is not major, and as such, this should not be the biggest determiner.
With so many hard disk brands, it’s comforting to know that your hard disk is from a trusted brand that has been tested and proven not to disappoint. For instance, you will notice that our list has been dominated by certain brands. Of course, there is no guarantee that a hard disk will not die on you but it’s better safe than sorry.

The following figure shows important ITIL Framework stages:
Service Strategy Operations ensure that services such as fulfilling user requests, working on service failures, fixing problems and carrying out routine operational tasks efficiently and effectively.
Here, are important services comes under this stage:
The Financial Management services provides a means of understanding and controlling costs and opportunities associated with services.
Service Portfolio Management helps you to organizes the process by which services are identified, evaluated, selected, and chartered.
The Demand Management is concerned with understanding and influencing customer demand. It also involves User Profiles, which characterize various groups of users for a given service.
This stage ensures agreed service are delivered when, where, and at the defined cost.
Here, are important services comes under this stage:
Service Level Management is deals with securing and managing agreements between customers and the service provider irrespective of the level of performance and reliability associated with specific services.

Capacity Management is focused with ensuring that at all times, the cost-effective capacity exists that meets or exceeds the demands of the business as established in Service Level Agreements
IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) process ensures that the service provider provides the minimum agreed-upon levels of service. It uses techniques like Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Management of Risk (MOR).
The Service Catalog is a subset which contains services available to customers and users.
The goal of the Service Transition process is to build and deploy IT services. It also make sure that changes to services and Service Management ITIL processes are conducted in a coordinated way.
Change management activity controls the lifecycle of all the changes with minimum disruption to IT services.
The goal of this service is to maintain information about configuration items needed to deliver an IT service, including their relationships.
This process helps you to plan, schedule, and control the movement of releases to conduct testing to live environments. It also ensures that the integrity of the live environment is protected and the correct components are released.
This ITIL process mainly focuses on planning and coordinating the use of resources to deploy a major release within the expected cost, time and quality.

The organization of a COBOL program is hierarchical. It’s not necessarily needed for all of the components to be present for the hierarchical relationship to exist.
Here, are various components of the COBOL program:
A division is a block of code, which usually contains one or more sections. It starts where the division name is encountered. It ends with the beginning of the next division.
Sections are the logical subdivision of the program logic. It is the collection of paragraphs.
Paragraphs are the portion of a selection which is a user-defined or predefined name which should be followed by a period. This section includes zero or more sentences.
Sentences are a combination of single or multiple statements. They should occur only in the procedure division. A sentence in COBOL language must end with a period(.).
These are the meaningful COBOL statements which perform some processing.
These are the lowest in the hierarchy which cannot be divided.
Various divisions in COBOL program structure are as follows:
It helps you to identify input and output files to the program.		
This section gives information regarding the system on which the program is written and run.
This section has two paragraphs:
Source computer – Complete program 		
Object computer –  Execute the program.
It has four sections:
Here, are some  most important coding rules while working with COBOL:
Here, some important syntax rules of COBOL:
In COBOL variable		is a named location in memory into which a program can put data and from which it can retrieve data. A data-name or identity. It is the name used to identify the area of memory that is reserved for the variable.
Variables must be described in terms of their size and type. Every variable used in a COBOL program should have encryption in the DATA DIVISION.
In COBOL, If else statement is used for conditional branching
The relational operators and some spelled out phrases can be used
If x < y – this can be written as if x is less than y
<, >, =,>=,<= are the available relational operators
NOT, AND, OR are logical operators used in COBOL
Greater than, less than, equal to are the spelled out phrases
To check an alpha number variable for what type of data it holds, we can use if x is number, if x is alphabetic, conditions. It is based on T or F value.
You can use if-then-else if for multi-level conditions
If no condition is matched, then the other clause is executed. This is quite similar to the switch statements in other languages.
Example 1 – Hello World!

Hive evolved as a data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop Map-Reduce framework.
The size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is growing and in a way, it is making traditional data warehousing solutions more expensive. Hadoop with MapReduce framework, is being used as an alternative solution for analyzing data sets with huge size. Though, Hadoop has proved useful for working on huge data sets, its MapReduce framework is very low level and it requires programmers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. Hive comes here for rescue of programmers.


Hive comes with a command-line shell interface which can be used to create tables and execute queries.
Hive query language is similar to SQL wherein it supports subqueries. With Hive query language, it is possible to take a MapReduce joins across Hive tables. It has a support for simple SQL like functions– CONCAT, SUBSTR, ROUND etc., and aggregation functions– SUM, COUNT, MAX etc. It also supports GROUP BY and SORT BY clauses. It is also possible to write user defined functions in Hive query language.
Apache Hive is a data warehouse framework for querying and analysis of data stored in HDFS. It is developed on top of Hadoop. Hive is an open-source software to analyze large data sets on Hadoop.

An organization needs to work with data which comes from different sources which can be in various file formats. The data should be extracted from a different source which can be from different servers or databases. This data is integrated into one standard format in a common staging area.
In this stage, the integrated data is still not prepared for visualization as the data needs processing. This data is pre-processed. For example, redundant values, missing values will be removed from the data set.
The business rule should be applied to the data when the data is cleaned. You can load that data back to Data Warehouse.
Once the data is loaded and processed, it can be visualized much better with use of various visualization that Power Bi has to offer. Use of dashboard and report helps one represent data more intuitively. This visual report helps business end users to take business decision based on the insights.

DAX is a formula expression language which is called (DAX) which can be used with various visualization tools like Power BI. It is also known as a functional language, where the full code is kept inside a function. DAX programming formulas contain two data types: Numeric and  Other.
Each is linked to the other by having common columns. Here is a simple diagram of Power BI Dashboard Example showing the relationships.
<img decoding="async" width="634" height="554" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/061419_0656_PowerBITuto10.png" alt="Dax Function">
There are 3 things in Power BI where you can use
DAX –
Let’s see all these Power BI examples and see how DAX functions works.
Calculated column allows you to create new columns based on the given data.
For example, there is no ‘ Final price’ column available in the  Items table.  Here, the DAX function is used to calculate a new column when only total price & quantity are available.
Price = List_Items[MRP]*List_Items[Qty]			
In the data shown in above Power BI example, each row will now have the respective calculated price.
You can perform a calculation using measure without the need to add any data as shown in the below Power BI example. This is very helpful for reports where the price can be displayed, without requiring an entirely new column to store it.
Example:
1] Total of the MRP column * Total of Qty column						
DAX functions in tabular model return entire tables. For example, In order to generate a list of all the country the organization has clients in, use the function:
cities touched = DISTINCT(Customers[City])			
Filters hide rows that don’t fit given criteria. A calculation after filtering out data will be applicable only on a row which matches those criteria.
Some Important DAX functions are:
This DAX function allows you to find the average from a given set of values as shown in the below Power BI example.
Example –
AvgComm = AVERAGE(List_Items[Price])	
Helps you to find the maximum from a given set of values.
Example – Find out the highest order.
HighSale = MAX(List_Items[Price])			
Helps you to find the minimum set of values.
Example –  Allows you to find out the lowest order.
LowestSale = MIN(List_Items[Price])			
Count any umerical data.
Example – Count number of ticket issued.
TicketVolume = COUNT(Invoices[Ticket])			
This function helps you to join values in calculated columns. You can use ConcatenateX if using in measures.
Example – Concatenate the Item names, and MRPs will give a unique code for all the price points at which each product is sold.
ProMrp = CONCATENATE(List_Items[Item],List_Items[MRP])			
The function allows you to calculate the sum from the start of the current Year to the specified date. It performs calculate base on a calendar year, not a financial year.
Example – Calculate Sales totals for the price column.
CumiSales = TOTALYTD(SUM(List_Items[Price]),Invoices[Date])				
Returns everything. Ignores filters.
Example – Used with the calculate function above.

QlikView is a windows only product, but it is genuinely optimized for 64 bit and multiple processors.
3) Cost effective:
QlikView is a memory resident app, so it is a highly cost-effective option for your organization.
4) Economical:
QlikView is very economical with disk space as the amount of memory depends upon the amount of data you want for each application.
Now in this QlikView tutorials guide, we will learn about QlikView History:
Now in this QlikView for dummies tutorial, we will learn about the architecture of QlikView:
The Qlik view architecture comprises of three main components, namely
All these components collectively help in designing, developing, and implement the QlikView application.
Let’s learn all these components in detail:
The QlikView Desktop is a Windows-based development tool. It is used by developers to use to create QlikView data model and GUI layout for application to use at frontend.
The developer prepares data for user to use in the desktop environment. They manipulate the data set using SQL like scripting.
Developers using code script, linkages/association between data fields and value can be established. The data can also be transformed. The files prepared using the Qlick view desktop can be used and shared in another QlikView application.
Applications created in the desktop version are hosted on Qlik View Server (QVS) so that user can access and use them anywhere. A QlikView server maintains communication between client/end users.
Qlikview server is supported by a powerful QLX engine which provides efficient in-memory data analysis, Data management, distribution, consolidation, scaling, and data access. It is the QVS server which provides data file from the backend to frontend users.
The QlikView Publisher is an optional mobile for the QlikView server-side component. This component allows you to fetch data from a data source like standard data files, Salesforce, and load data directly into QlikView files.
It allows you to conduct data distribution through scheduling and administering tasks. Qlik View Publisher also helps you to reduce unnecessary data load and traffic by efficient distribution.
Qlick view management console is a  platform that centrally manages all the other QlikView components. It is a web-based interface and a server-side app controlled by IT professionals.
QlikView User Access allows customers to access and manipulate data files. The access points for the user are mostly web browsers which can open using desktop, mobile, laptops, etc.
Therefore, when the user opens a document in Qlickview and requests to load a data file, the file fetch by the service from the backend is always in the original format. However, the QlikView document made using that file is still in .qvw extension.

A distributed application is an application which can run on multiple systems in a network. It runs simultaneously by coordinating themselves to complete a certain task. These tasks may take plenty of hours to complete by any non-distributed application.
Apache Zookeeper is an open source distributed coordination service that helps to manage a large set of hosts. Management and coordination in a distributed environment is tricky. Zookeeper automates this process and allows developers to focus on building software features rather than worry about it’s distributed nature.
Zookeeper helps you to maintain configuration information, naming, group services for distributed applications. It implements different protocols on the cluster so that the application should not implement on their own. It provides a single coherent view of multiple machines.
Here, are important reasons behind the popularity of the Zookeeper:
Here is a brief explanation about Apache Zookeeper architecture:
Server: The server sends an acknowledge when any client connects. In the case when there is no response from the connected server, the client automatically redirects the message to another server.
Client: Client is one of the nodes in the distributed application cluster. It helps you to accesses information from the server. Every client sends a message to the server at regular intervals that helps the server to know that the client is alive.
Leader: One of the servers is designated a Leader. It gives all the information to the clients as well as an acknowledgment that the server is alive. It would performs automatic recovery if any of the connected nodes failed.
Follower: Server node which follows leader instruction is called a follower.
Ensemble/Cluster: Group of Zookeeper servers which is called ensemble or a Cluster. You can use ZooKeeper infrastructure in the cluster mode to have the system at the optimal value when you are running the Apache.
ZooKeeper WebUI: If you want to work with ZooKeeper resource management, then you need to use WebUI. It allows working with ZooKeeper using the web user interface, instead of using the command line. It offers fast and effective communication with the ZooKeeper application.
Now in this ZooKeeper tutorial, let’s learn about Zookeeper Data Model. The Below figure explains Apache Zookeeper Data Model:
There are three types of Znodes:
Persistence znode: This type of znode is alive even after the client which created that specific znode, is disconnected. By default, in zookeeper, all nodes are persistent if it is not specified.
Ephemeral znode: This type of zookeeper znode are alive until the client is alive. Therefore, when the client gets a disconnect from the zookeeper, it will also be deleted. Moreover, ephemeral nodes are not allowed to have children.
Sequential znode: Sequential znodes can be either ephemeral or persistent. So when a new znode is created as a sequential znode. You can assign the path of the znode by attaching a 10 digit sequence number to the original name.
Zookeeper, a watch event is a one-time trigger which is sent to the client that set watch. It occurred when data from that watch changes. ZDM watch allows clients to get notifications when znode changes. ZDM read operations like getData(), getChidleren(), exist have the option of setting a watch.
Watches are ordered, the order of watch events corresponds to the order of the updates. A client will able to see a watch event for znode before seeing the new data which corresponds to that znode.
Zookeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes. ACL is made up of a pair of (Scheme: id, permission)
Build in ACL schemes:
world: has a single id, anyone
auth: Not use any id, It represents any authenticated user
digest: use a username: password
host: Allows you to use client’s hostname as ACL id identity
IP: use the client host IP address as ACL id identity
ACL Permissions:

Hbase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). In this HBase tutorial for beginners, you will learn Apache HBase basics and advanced concepts. This HBase course contains all the HBase basics from introduction, installation, architecture to advanced stuff.
HBase is an open-source, column-oriented distributed database system in a Hadoop environment. Initially, it was Google Big Table, afterward; it was renamed as HBase and is primarily written in Java.  Apache HBase is needed for real-time Big Data applications.
HBase can store massive amounts of data from terabytes to petabytes. The tables present in HBase consist of billions of rows having millions of columns. HBase is built for low latency operations, which is having some specific features compared to traditional relational models.
Here is what we cover in this Apache HBase Training Guide


In this HBase tutorial for beginners, you will learn What Apache HBase is, the Architecture of HBase, How to install HBase, Steps to create a table in HBase, HBase Advantage and Limitations, etc.
A table for a popular web application may consist of billions of rows. If we want to search a particular row from such a huge amount of data, HBase is the ideal choice as query fetch time is less. Most of the online analytics applications use HBase.
Traditional relational data models fail to meet the performance requirements of very big databases. These performance and processing limitations can be overcome by Apache HBase.


In big data analytics, Hadoop plays a vital role in solving typical business problems by managing large data sets and gives the best solutions in analytics domain.
In the Hadoop ecosystem, each component plays its unique role for the
In terms of storing unstructured, semi-structured data storage as well as retrieval of such data’s, relational databases are less useful. Also, fetching results by applying query on huge data sets that are stored in Hadoop storage is a challenging task. NoSQL storage technologies provide the best solution for faster querying on huge datasets.
Some of the NoSQL models present in the market are Cassandra, MongoDB, and CouchDB. Each of these models has different ways of storage mechanism.
For example, MongoDB is a document-oriented database from the NoSQL family tree. Compared to traditional databases, it provides the best features in terms of performance, availability, and scalability. It is an open-source document-oriented database, and it’s written in C++.
Cassandra is also a distributed database from open-source Apache software which is designed to handle a huge amount of data stored across commodity servers. Cassandra provides high availability with no single point of failure.
While CouchDB is a document-oriented database in which each document fields are stored in key-value maps.
HBase storage model is different from other NoSQL models discussed above. This can be stated as follow.
MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra are NoSQL type databases that are feature specific and used as per their business needs. Here, we have listed out different NoSQL database as per their use case.
While comparing HBase with Traditional Relational databases, we have to take three key areas into consideration. Those are data model, data storage, and data diversity.
HBase provides unique features and will solve typical industrial use cases. As column-oriented storage, it provides fast querying, fetching of results, and a high amount of data storage. This course is a complete step-by-step introduction to HBase.

In this pytorch tutorial, you will learn all the concepts from scratch. This tutorial covers basic to advanced topics like pytorch definition, advantages and disadvantages of pytorch, comparison, installation, pytorch framework, regression, and image classification. This pytorch tutorial is absolutely free.
PyTorch is an open-source Torch based Machine Learning library for natural language processing using Python. It is similar to NumPy but with powerful GPU support. It offers Dynamic Computational Graphs that you can modify on the go with the help of autograd. PyTorch is also faster than some other frameworks. It was developed by Facebook’s AI Research Group in 2016.
Following are the advantages and disadvantages of PyTorch:
As mentioned above, you can define the network model easily, and you can understand the code quickly without much training.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="738" height="198" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto1.gif" alt="Dynamic Computational Graph">
Image Source: Exploring Deep Learning with PyTorch
Pytorch offers Dynamic Computational Graph (DAG). Computational graphs is a way to express mathematical expressions in graph models or theories such as nodes and edges. The node will do the mathematical operation, and the edge is a Tensor that will be fed into the nodes and carries the output of the node in Tensor.
DAG is a graph that holds arbitrary shape and able to do operations between different input graphs. Every iteration, a new graph is created. So, it is possible to have the same graph structure or create a new graph with a different operation, or we can call it a dynamic graph.
Communities and researchers, benchmark and compare frameworks to see which one is faster.  A GitHub repo Benchmark on Deep Learning Frameworks and GPUs reported that PyTorch is faster than the other framework in terms of images processed per second.
As you can see below, the comparison graphs with vgg16 and resnet152
<img decoding="async" width="764" height="441" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto2.png" alt="Advantages of PyTorch">
<img decoding="async" width="728" height="371" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto3.png" alt="Advantages of PyTorch">
PyTorch is more python based. For example, if you want to train a model,  you can use native control flow such as looping and recursions without the need to add more special variables or sessions to be able to run them. This is very helpful for the training process.
Pytorch also implements Imperative Programming, and it’s definitely more flexible. So, it’s possible to print out the tensor value in the middle of a computation process.
PyTorch requires third-party applications for Visualization. It also needs an API server for production.
Next in this PyTorch tutorial, we will learn about the difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow.
It’s straightforward to install it in Linux. You can choose to use a virtual environment or install it directly with root access. Type this command in the terminal
Sagemaker is one of the platforms in Amazon Web Service that offers a powerful Machine Learning engine with pre-installed deep learning configurations for data scientist or developers to build, train, and deploy models at any scale.
First Open the Amazon Sagemaker console and click on  Create notebook instance and fill all the details for your notebook.
<img decoding="async" width="840" height="1034" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto5.png" alt="AWS Sagemaker">
Next Step,  Click on Open to launch your notebook instance.
<img decoding="async" width="782" height="102" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto6.png" alt="AWS Sagemaker">
Finally, In Jupyter, Click on New and choose conda_pytorch_p36 and you are ready to use your notebook instance with Pytorch installed.
Next in this PyTorch tutorial, we will learn about PyTorch framework basics.
Let’s learn the basic concepts of PyTorch before we deep dive. PyTorch uses Tensor for every variable similar to numpy’s ndarray but with GPU computation support.  Here we will explain the network model, loss function, Backprop, and Optimizer.
The network can be constructed by subclassing the torch.nn. There are 2 main parts,
As you can see above, you create a class of nn.Module called Model. It contains 2 Conv2d layers and a Linear layer. The first conv2d layer takes an input of 3 and the output shape of 20. The second layer will take an input of 20 and will produce an output shape of 40. The last layer is a fully connected layer in the shape of 320 and will produce an output of 10.
The forward process will take an input of X and feed it to the conv1 layer and perform ReLU function,
Similarly, it will also feed the conv2 layer. After that, the x will be reshaped into (-1, 320) and feed into the final FC layer. Before you send the output, you will use the softmax activation function.
The backward process is automatically defined by autograd, so you only need to define the forward process.
The loss function is used to measure how well the prediction model is able to predict the expected results. PyTorch already has many standard loss functions in the torch.nn module. For example, you can use the Cross-Entropy Loss to solve a multi-class PyTorch classification problem. It’s easy to define the loss function and compute the losses:
It’s easy to use your own loss function calculation with PyTorch.
To perform the backpropagation, you simply call the los.backward(). The error will be computed but remember to clear the existing gradient with zero_grad()
The torch.optim provides common optimization algorithms. You can define an optimizer with a simple step:
You need to pass the    network model parameters and the learning rate so that at every iteration the parameters will be updated after the backprop process.
Let’s learn simple regression with PyTorch examples:
Step 1) Creating our network model
Our network model is a simple Linear layer with an input and an output shape of 1.
And the network output should be like this
Step 2) Test Data
Before you start the training process, you need to know our data. You make a random function to test our model.   Y = x3 sin(x)+ 3x+0.8 rand(100)
Here is the scatter plot of our function:
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto7.png" alt="Scatter Plot of Simple Regression with PyTorch">
Before you start the training process, you need to convert the numpy array to Variables that supported by Torch and autograd as shown in the below PyTorch regression example.
Step 3) Optimizer and Loss
Next, you should define the Optimizer and the Loss Function for our training process.
Step 4) Training
Now let’s start our training process. With an epoch of 250, you will iterate our data to find the best value for our hyperparameters.
Step 5) Result
As you can see below, you successfully performed PyTorch regression with a neural network. Actually, on every iteration, the red line in the plot will update and change its position to fit the data. But in this picture, it only show you the final result as shown in the below PyTorch example:
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto8.png" alt="Scatter Plot of Simple Regression Result">
One of the popular methods to learn the basics of deep learning is with the MNIST dataset. It is the “Hello World” in deep learning. The dataset contains handwritten numbers from 0 – 9 with the total of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples that are already labeled with the size of 28×28 pixels.
<img decoding="async" width="495" height="494" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto9.png" alt="Image Classification with PyTorch">
Step 1) Preprocess the Data
In the first step of this PyTorch classification example, you will load the dataset using torchvision module.
Before you start the training process, you need to understand the data. Torchvision will load the dataset and transform the images with the appropriate requirement for the network such as the shape and normalizing the images.
The transform function converts the images into tensor and normalizes the value. The function torchvision.transforms.MNIST, will download the dataset (if it’s not available) in the directory, set the dataset for training if necessary and do the transformation process.
To visualize the dataset, you use the data_iterator to get the next batch of images and labels. You use matplot to plot these images and their appropriate label. As you can see below our images and their labels.
<img decoding="async" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/111318_0831_PyTorchTuto10.png" alt="Image Classification Example with PyTorch">
Step 2) Network Model Configuration
Now in this PyTorch example, you will make a simple neural network for PyTorch image classification.
Here, we introduce you another way to create the Network model in PyTorch. We will use nn.Sequential to make a sequence model instead of making a subclass of nn.Module.
 Here is the output of our network model
Step 3)Train the Model
Before you start the training process, it is required to set up the criterion and optimizer function.
For the criterion, you will use the CrossEntropyLoss. For the Optimizer, you will use the SGD with a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum of 0.9 as shown in the below PyTorch example.
The forward process will take the input shape and pass it to the first conv2d layer. Then from there, it will be feed into the maxpool2d and finally put into the ReLU activation function. The same process will occur in the second conv2d layer. After that, the input will be reshaped into (-1,320) and feed into the fc layer to predict the output.
Now, you will start the training process. You will iterate through our dataset 2 times or with an epoch of 2 and print out the current loss at every 2000 batch.
At each epoch, the enumerator will get the next tuple of input and corresponding labels. Before we feed the input to our network model, we need to clear the previous gradient. This is required because after the backward process  (backpropagation process), the gradient will be accumulated instead of being replaced. Then, we will calculate the losses from the predicted output from the expected output. After that, we will do a backpropagation to calculate the gradient, and finally, we will update the parameters.
Here’s the output of the training process
Step 4) Test the Model
After you train our model, you need to test or evaluate with other sets of images.
We will use an iterator for the test_loader, and it will generate a batch of images and labels that will be passed to the trained model. The predicted output will be displayed and compared with the expected output.

Keras is an Open Source Neural Network library written in Python that runs on top of Theano or Tensorflow. It is designed to be modular, fast and easy to use. It was developed by François Chollet, a Google engineer. Keras doesn’t handle low-level computation. Instead, it uses another library to do it, called the “Backend.
Keras is high-level API wrapper for the low-level API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Keras High-Level API handles the way we make models, defining layers, or set up multiple input-output models. In this level, Keras also compiles our model with loss and optimizer functions, training process with fit function. Keras in Python doesn’t handle Low-Level API such as making the computational graph, making tensors or other variables because it has been handled by the “backend” engine.
Backend is a term in Keras that performs all low-level computation such as tensor products, convolutions and many other things with the help of other libraries such as Tensorflow or Theano. So, the “backend engine” will perform the computation and development of the models. Tensorflow is the default “backend engine” but we can change it in the configuration.
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori1.png" alt="Backend of Theano" width="450" height="144">
Theano is an open source project that was developed by the MILA group at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the first widely used Framework. It is a Python library that helps in multi-dimensional arrays for mathematical operations using Numpy or Scipy. Theano can use GPUs for faster computation, it also can automatically build symbolic graphs for computing gradients. On its website, Theano claims that it can recognize numerically unstable expressions and compute them with more stable algorithms, this is very useful for our unstable expressions.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori2.png" alt="Backend of TensorFlow" width="500" height="93">
On the other hand, Tensorflow is the rising star in deep learning framework. Developed by Google’s Brain team it is the most popular deep learning tool. With a lot of features, and researchers contribute to help develop this framework for deep learning purposes.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori3.jpg" alt="Backend of CNTK" width="640" height="334">
Another backend engine for Keras is The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit or CNTK. It is an open-source deep learning framework that was developed by Microsoft Team. It can run on multi GPUs or multi-machine for training deep learning model on a massive scale. In some cases, CNTK was reported faster than other frameworks such as Tensorflow or Theano. Next in this Keras CNN tutorial, we will compare the backends of Theano, TensorFlow and CNTK.
We need to do a benchmark In order to know the comparison between these two backends. As you can see in Jeong-Yoon Lee’s benchmark, the performance of 3 different backends on different hardware is compared. And the result is Theano is slower than the other backend, it is reported 50 times slower, but the accuracy is close to each other.
Another benchmark test is performed by Jasmeet Bhatia. He reported that Theano is slower than Tensorflow for some test. But overall accuracy is nearly the same for every network that was tested.
So, between Theano, Tensorflow and CTK it’s obvious that TensorFlow is better than Theano. With TensorFlow, the computation time is much shorter and CNN is better than the others.
Next in this Keras Python tutorial, we will learn about the difference between Keras and TensorFlow (Keras vs Tensorflow).
Keras is very quick to make a network model. If you want to make a simple network model with a few lines, Python Keras can help you with that. Look at the Keras example below:
Because of friendly the API, we can easily understand the process. Writing the code with a simple function and no need to set multiple parameters.
There are lots of AI communities that use Keras for their Deep Learning framework. Many of them publish their codes as well tutorials to the general public.
You can choose Tensorflow, CNTK, and Theano as your backend with Keras. You can choose a different backend for different projects depending on your needs. Each backend has its own unique advantage.
With a variety of supported devices and platforms, you can deploy Keras on any device like
You can train Keras on a single GPU or use multiple GPUs at once. Because Keras has a built-in support for data parallelism so it can process large volumes of  data and speed up the time needed to train it.
Keras only handles high-level API which runs on top other framework or backend engine such as Tensorflow, Theano, or CNTK. So it’s not very useful if you want to make your own abstract layer for your research purposes because Keras already have pre-configured layers.
In this section, we will look into various methods available to install Keras
Which one is better? Direct install to the current python or use a virtual environment? I suggest using a virtual environment if you have many projects. Want to know why? This is because different projects may use a different version of a keras library.
For example, I have a project that needs Python 3.5 using OpenCV 3.3 with older Keras-Theano backend but in the other project I have to use Keras with the latest version and a Tensorflow as it backend with Python 3.6.6 support
We don’t want the Keras library to conflict at each other right? So we use a Virtual Environment to localize the project with a specific type of library or we can use another platform such as Cloud Service to do our computation for us like Amazon Web Service.
Amazon Web Service is a platform that offers Cloud Computing service and products for researchers or any other purposes. AWS rent their hardware, networking, Database, etc. so that we can use it directly from the internet. One of the popular AWS service for deep learning purpose is the Amazon Machine Image Deep Learning Service or DL
For detailed instructions on how to use AWS, refer this tutorial
Note on the AMI: You will have the following AMI available
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori4.png" alt="Installing Keras on AWS" width="1148" height="461">
AWS Deep Learning AMI is a virtual environment in AWS EC2 Service that helps researchers or practitioners to work with Deep Learning. DLAMI offers from small CPUs engine up to high-powered multi GPUs engines with preconfigured CUDA, cuDNN, and comes with a variety of deep learning frameworks.
If you want to use it instantly, you should choose Deep Learning AMI because it comes preinstalled with  popular deep learning frameworks.
But if you want to try a custom deep learning framework for research, you should install the Deep Learning Base AMI because it comes with fundamental libraries such as CUDA, cuDNN, GPUs drivers, and other needed libraries to run with your deep learning environment.
Amazon SageMaker is a deep learning platform to help you with training and deploying deep learning network with the best algorithm.
As a beginner, this is by far the easiest method to use Keras. Below is a process on how to install Keras on Amazon SageMaker:
Step 1) Open Amazon SageMaker
In the first step, Open the Amazon Sagemaker console and click on  Create notebook instance.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori5.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="1322" height="215">
Step 2) Enter the details
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori6.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="840" height="1034">
Note: If you want to access resources from your VPC, set the direct internet access as enabled. Otherwise, this notebook instance will not have an internet access, so it is impossible to train or host models
Step 3) Launch the instance
Click on Open to launch the instance
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori7.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="782" height="102">
Step 4) Start coding
In Jupyter, Click on New> conda_tensorflow_p36 and you are ready to code
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori8.png" alt="Install Keras on Amazon SageMaker" width="683" height="486">
To enable Keras with Tensorflow as its backend engine, we need to install Tensorflow first. Run this command to install tensorflow with CPU (no GPU)
if you want to enable the GPU support for tensorflow you can use this command
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori9.png" alt="Install Keras on Linux" width="599" height="637">
let’s check in Python to see if our installation is successful by typing
if there is no error message, the installation process is successful
After we install Tensorflow, let’s start installing keras. Type this command in the terminal
it will begin installing Keras and also all of its dependencies.You should see something like this :
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori10.png" alt="Install Keras" width="716" height="339">
Now we have Keras Installed in our system!
Before we start using Keras, we should check if our Keras use Tensorflow as it backend by open the configuration file:
you should see something like this
as you can see, the “backend” use tensorflow. It means that keras are using Tensorflow as it backend as we expected
and now run it on the terminal by typing
Before we install Tensorflow and Keras, we should install Python, pip, and virtualenv. If you already installed these libraries, you should continue to the next step, otherwise do this:
Install Python 3 by downloading from this link
Install pip by running this
Install virtualenv with this command
Install Microsoft Visual C++  2015 Redistributable Update 3
Then run this script
Setup Virtual Environment
This is used to isolate the working system with the main system.
Activate the environment
After preparing the environment, Tensorflow and Keras installation remains same as Linux. Next in this Deep learning with Keras tutorial, we will learn about Keras fundamentals for Deep learning.


The main structure in Keras is the Model which defines the complete graph of a network. You can add more layers to an existing model to build a custom model that you need for your project.
Here’s how to make a Sequential Model and a few commonly used layers in deep learning
1. Sequential Model
2. Convolutional Layer
This is a Keras Python example of convolutional layer as the input layer with the input shape of 320x320x3, with 48 filters of size 3×3 and use ReLU as an activation function.
another type is
3. MaxPooling Layer
To downsample the input representation, use MaxPool2d and specify the kernel size
4. Dense Layer
adding a Fully Connected Layer with just specifying the output Size
5. Dropout Layer
Adding dropout layer with 50% probability
Compiling, Training, and Evaluate
After we define our model, let’s start to train them. It is required to compile the network first with the loss function and optimizer function. This will allow the network to change weights and minimized the loss.
Now to start training, use fit to fed the training and validation data to the model. This will allow you to train the network in batches and set the epochs.
Our final step is to evaluate the model with the test data.
Lets try using simple linear regression
After training the data, the output should look like this
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori11.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="640" height="480">
with the initial weight
and final weight
Why we use Fine Tune Models and when we use it
Fine-tuning is a task to tweak a pre-trained model such that the parameters would adapt to the new model. When we want to train from scratch on a new model, we need a large amount of data, so that the network can find all parameters. But in this case, we will use a pre-trained model so the parameters are already learned and have a weight.
For example, if we want to train our own Keras model to solve a classification problem but we only have a small amount of data, then we can solve this by using a Transfer Learning + Fine-Tuning method.
Using a pre-trained network & weights we don’t need to train the whole network. We just need to train the last layer that is used to solve our task as we call it Fine-Tuning method.
For the pre-trained model, we can load a variety of models that Keras already has in its library such as:
But in this process, we will use VGG16 network model and the imageNet as our weight for the model. We will fine-tune a network to classify 8 different types of classes using Images from Kaggle Natural Images Dataset
VGG16 model architecture
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori12.png" alt="VGG16 model architecture" width="470" height="331">
source
For our training process, we will use a picture of natural images from 8 different classes such as airplanes, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike, and person. First, we need to upload our data to Amazon S3 Bucket.
Step 1) After login to your S3 account, let’s create a bucket by clocking Create Bucket
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori13.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="350" height="111">
Step 2) Now choose a Bucket Name and your Region according to your account. Make sure that the bucket name is available. After that click Create.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori14.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="469" height="394">
Step 3) As you can see, your Bucket is ready to use. But as you can see, the Access is Not public, it is good for you if you want to keep it private for yourself. You can change this bucket for Public Access in the Bucket Properties
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori15.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="462" height="165">
Step 4) Now you start uploading your training data to your Bucket. Here I will upload the tar.gz file which consist of pictures for training and testing process.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori16.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="931" height="272">
Step 5) Now click on your file and copy the Link so that we can download it.
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori17.png" alt="Uploading Data to AWS S3 Bucket" width="317" height="214">
We need to generate our training data using the Keras ImageDataGenerator.
First you must download using wget with the link to your file from S3 Bucket.
After you download the data let’s start the Training Process.
The ImageDataGenerator will make an X_training data from a directory. The sub-directory in that directory will be used as a class for each object. The image will be loaded with the RGB color mode, with the categorical class mode for the Y_training data, with a batch size of 16.  Finally, shuffle the data.
Let’s see our images randomly by plotting them with matplotlib

After that let’s create our network model from VGG16 with imageNet pre-trained weight. We will freeze these layers so that the layers are not trainable to help us reduce the computation time.
As you can see below, the summary of our network model. From an input from VGG16 Layers, then we add 2 Fully Connected Layer which will extract 1024 features and an output layer that will compute the 8 classes with the softmax activation.

As you can see, our losses are dropped significantly and the accuracy is almost 100%. For testing our model, we randomly picked images over the internet and put it on the test folder with a different class to test
And our test is as given below! Only 1 image is predicted wrong from a test of 14 images!

We need Recognition to make it easier for us to recognize or identify a person’s face, objects type, estimated age of a person from his face, or even know the facial expressions of that person.

Maybe you realize every time you try to mark your friend’s face in a photo, the feature in Facebook has done it for you, that is marking your friend’s face without you needing to mark it first. This is Face Recognition applied by Facebook to make it easier for us to tag friends.
So how does it work? Every time we mark the face of our friend, Facebook’s AI will learn it and will try to predict it until it gets the right result. The same system we will use to make our own Face Recognition. Let’s start making our own Face Recognition using Deep Learning
We will use a VGG16 Network Model but with VGGFace weight.
VGG16 model architecture

What is VGGFace? it is Keras implementation of Deep Face Recognition introduced by Parkhi, Omkar M. et al. “Deep Face Recognition.” BMVC (2015). The framework uses VGG16 as the network architecture.
You can download the VGGFace from github
As you can see the network summary
we will do a Transfer Learning + Fine Tuning to make the training quicker with small datasets. First, we will freeze the base layers so that the layers are not trainable.
then we add our own layer to recognize our test faces. We will add 2 fully connected layer and an output layer with 5 people to detect.
Let’s see our network summary
As you can see above, after the pool5 layer, it will be flattened into a single feature vector that will be used by the dense layer for the final recognition.
Now let’s prepare our faces. I made a directory consist of 5 famous people
Each folder contains 10 pictures, for each training and evaluation process. It is a very small amount of data but that is the challenge, right?
We will use the help of Keras tool to help us prepare the data. This function will iterate in the dataset folder and then prepare it so it can be used in the training.
Let’s begin our training process by compiling our network with loss function and optimizer. Here, we use sparse_categorical_crossentropy as our loss function, with the help of SGD as our learning optimizer.
As you can see, our validation accuracy is up to 64%, this is a good result for a small amount of training data. We can improve this by adding more layer or add more training images so that our model can learn more about the faces and achieving more accuracy.
Let’s test our model with a test picture
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/102518_0856_KerasTutori23.jpg" alt="Test Picture" width="320" height="320">
using Robert Downey Jr. picture as our test picture, it shows that the predicted face is true!
How about if we test our skill with implementing it with an input from a webcam? Using OpenCV with Haar Face cascade to find our face and with the help of our network model, we can recognize the person.
The first step is to prepare you and your friend’s faces. The more data we have then the better the result is!
Prepare and train your network like the previous step, after training is complete, add this line to get the input image from cam
Keras offers simplicity when writing the script. We can start writing and understand directly with Keras as it’s not too hard to understand. It is more user-friendly and easy to implement, no need to make many variables to run the model. So, we don’t need to understand every detail in the backend process.
On the other hand, Tensorflow is the low-level operations that offer flexibility and advanced operations if you want to make an arbitrary computational graph or model. Tensorflow also can visualize the process with the help of TensorBoard and a specialized debugger tool.
So, if you want to start working with deep learning with not that much complexity, use Keras. Because Keras offers simplicity and user-friendly to use and easy to implement than Tensorflow. But if you want to write your own algorithm in deep learning project or research, you should use Tensorflow instead.
So let’s summarize everything we have discussed and done in this tutorial.
